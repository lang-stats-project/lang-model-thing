in washington and robert novak of the chicago sun time who is in littl rock arkansa robert why the latest on thi map well there realli isnt much chang from what we had two week ago we did put move louisiana which im convinc of from clinton to bush we put two other state in the opposit direct mostli becaus we were just late in catch up with it georgia and south dakota actual berni our map is a littl bit optimist from bush standpoint becaus texa is as mark sai virtual a toss up were just not a littl chicken like mark who call toss up we call everyth and the other on is florida florida the clinton peopl think theyr ahead in florida i still think bush is slightli ahead but it almost a toss up you put florida and texa in the clinton column and youv got an elector vote landslid mark shield why is texa a toss up texa is a toss up becaus of the <unk> in a big foot wai of ross perot ross perot is the wild card in thi elect onli in term of the debat which i think he can influenc and i think probabl will begin sundai night but certainli in texa he is a forc to be reckon with i think berni just on thing id add to what bob the point that bob wa make what is most interest perhap is not the area of disagr but the area of agreement were look at state like illinoi and new jersei that have not vote democrat sinc nineteen sixti four that virtual everybodi includ california of cours everybodi is conced at thi point or practic everybodi is conced to bill clinton were talk beyond the <unk> and the new <unk> which wa well which went all the wai back to nineteen sixti four connecticut to nineteen sixti eight i mean thi is an enorm chang in the american polit landscap so what must georg bush do between now and novemb third to try to turn around what you gui see as hi fate await him theoret berni he ha to show the american peopl that hi second term will be better than hi first that he stand for someth he been unabl to do that he hasnt done the thing that he could have done like introduc a new team new cabinet member actual make some cabinet chang have a veri steadi agenda for the second term so what he is left with sinc he unabl to do that and it realli too late to do that is he must make the american peopl feel that bill clinton is too big a risk to take and thei either have got to go for perot or for bush and that why were have all thi stuff about clinton trip to russia and hi organ of student demonstr dure the vietnam war mark berni let me just sai that the onli hope that georg bush ha left is to somehow persuad voter look im not dai at the beach but the other gui no month in the countri and somehow concentr the doubt rais doubt about bill clinton ill be honest with you i think go back to nineteen sixti nine and a christma trip to moscow is a reach beyond most peopl even remot understand i mean what he suggest that weve got a <unk> candid on our hand somebodi who ha been plant with a time capsul that upon the moment he take the oath of offic i mean thi is truli bizarr and when the presid of the unit state sai i dont want to tell you what i ralli think i mean it tell you someth pretti sad about georg bush sixti eight year old run for reelect two term as vice presid on term as presid and he into sort of thi specul about what happen in nineteen sixti nine over christma it just it wont fly well go ahead bob let me make two point on it i wa im in littl rock and i wa with some clinton peopl last night and thei were flabbergast by it you know thei were angri but it is it is a shock in the to the whole system and it mai not work it probabl wont work but it doe shake up the tabl a littl bit secondli if bush wa go to do it what he had to do it in the context of the draft of sai that here wa a gui who wa avoid the draft who wa avoid the draft who had <unk> on a commit for an air forc r o t c and then he goe to russia but just to throw it out what wa he do in russia is silli i think bob is i think bob is right on thi on and i just want to underlin that bill clinton is clearli uncomfort talk about the event of nineteen sixti nine but thi is not the vulner point for georg bush were go into a debat where were talk about eighti percent of american think the economi is head in the wrong direct and the countri is serious off on the wrong track i dont think thi is the answer to georg bush problem on word is bush desper of cours he desper i dont think he pathet as clinton sai thei keep us word pathet and desper well of cours theyr desper there thirti two thirti on dai left and noth is work noth is work for bush all right let me ask you notwithstand what each of you ha said about bush and moscow and clinton which segment of the nation popul which section of the countri would bush innuendo about bill clinton reson i think berni that it an attempt to win back the southern unit state where militari servic more than the rest of the countri ha alwai been a respect and even rever profess and a section of the countri which ever sinc the war between the state if anyth ha been more nationalist than the nation as a whole i think that is the hope the other thing is berni it put heroin into the bloodstream that what it is you drop a littl poison in like thi it never realli goe awai it like the charg of senat steve <unk> in nineteen eighti eight that kitti dukaki michael <unk> wife had particip in a flag burn there wa noth to support it noth to substanti it but it just to try an plant a doubt and itll be there in peopl mind but it is the onli thing peopl ar talk about were talk about it it wa the sound bite lead off thi morn new program there no discuss todai of the compar tax program well is thi <unk> as some have said well i guess you know i knew joe mccarthi and ah georg bush is no joe mccarthi georg bush is no joe mccarthi i mean who ar you flatter there bob joe didnt do ani innuendo i mean joe joe would have said the gui wa a communist so peopl have gotten a lot more delic in the last four year no i wouldnt call thi <unk> i would like to see a littl bit more anger on governor clinton part in hi respons and reaction to him well but wait a minut mark you know clinton ha a reput of have a temper as a campaign would he want to show that temper i tell you i mean when a charg is made and it total baseless which the clinton peopl insist that it is and certainli independ investig ha suggest so far that it is then legitim anger commensur with the charg which is a seriou charg is absolut expect by peopl and theyr will to not onli to toler theyr kind of disappoint when thei dont see it well let me agre with mark on that that the obvious i think everyth that governor clinton doe is calcul he a profession politician and a veri good on and he decid to take thi veri soft tone and i think the soft tone make peopl sai hei what wa he do there wa there someth funni go on gentlemen nice to hear your thought catherin thank berni,

4,204,the torch pass to bill clinton and a new gener tonight top stori on washington week in review now here moder paul duke good even the big inaugur parti is over and bill clinton live in the white hous the new presid is promis dramat chang and ask american to tighten their belt to assur a brighter futur for all but thi promis of a new dai ha alreadi run into some stormi weather on capitol hill forc the withdraw of on of mr clinton kei nomin that of connecticut lawyer zoe baird to be attornei gener but by and larg the week ha been on long festiv of renew with american pour into the capit to join in the celebr here now to look at thi first week that wa charl mcdowel of the richmond time dispatch gloria borger of u s new and world report jack nelson of the lo angel time and howard fineman of newsweek a new presid for a new ag howard that right paul befor we plung back into the routin of zoe baird and american plane fire more missil at iraqi instal i think we ought to paus and rememb what wa realli signific about thi week which is the tremend sens of social and gener chang that you saw and felt here in washington i wa sit right below clinton when he gave hi inaugur address and i think among the most memor thing that he said wa that it our time let us embrac it and he also said that by the word we speak and the face we show we forc the spring in other word that sens of renew come as much from the pageantri as from the word and on that inaugur dai i just want to mention a few thing that i saw and heard that i think express all of that sens of chang on of them wa i wa sit next to the congression <unk> section and unlik four year ago there were a lot of men in the congression <unk> section and in the v i p section which wa right next to that there were the usual number of fur coat linda bird johnson in fact had a stole that she said her mother had worn to the kennedi inaugur in nineteen sixti on but there were also african american in tradit garb color garb from their nativ contin then i rememb leav the capitol ground and walk through the cordon off street of washington back toward the white hous thei were cordon off for the parad no traffic a kind of eeri sens of calm and silenc there and there were fleet of young adult on roller blade i dont think iv ever seen so mani kid on roller blade and there were street drummer with turn over plastic drum just drum up a storm and then that night we went to the m t v inaugur ball and i want to be care here becaus thi wa not woodstock i mean it wa a corpor event sponsor by a big fortun five hundr corpor there were lot of washington insid and hollywood type there but around midnight don <unk> the rock star got togeth with a high school choir and togeth thei <unk> out a <unk> of bob <unk> famou song anthem the time thei ar <unk> and even though as i sai it wa insid in the room there wa some distant sens there of someth realli signific happen <unk> social but i also think it wa a warn it wa a celebr and a warn becaus bob dylan wa write in protest to the previou gener now the babi boomer ar in charg somewher out there there a scrawni kid a young bob dylan and he go to be write protest song as the babi boomer run thing the inaugur speech wa well receiv here in washington howard and on of the thing that presid clinton made clear invok the name of f d r wa that he doe intend to be an activist presid well i think he tri to show that by the word by the <unk> of the speech he said all right let get down to busi here it wa onli fourteen minut long it wa punchi and auster i think but also signal activ which he then tri to follow up on thi week on fridai in hi second full in the white hous he sign a big bunch of execut order that basic revers twelv year of abort polici in thi countri and everyth from allow abort counsel in clinic to allow the <unk> of the french abort pill to chang in intern polici he sign a whole bunch of order on that and i think he want to show and i think with some success that he wa go to be an activ presid on of the thing he talk about howard that he never talk about dure the campaign wa sacrific and it sound like he wa try to get peopl readi for mayb tax increas mayb even the middl class that he promis a tax decreas to well he mayb a cutback in govern benefit yeah he promis to be the peopl presid and i think the pageantri of thi inaugur pretti successfulli show that everyth from start out at <unk> thoma jefferson home through the hour that he spent greet averag american in the white hous but the paradox and the challeng is that in order to be a success peopl presid he go to have to convinc the peopl that there some share sacrific involv thi is not an easi or painless thing to do for essenti a friendli gui and so hi great challeng is go to be to us hi intim style hi sens of empathi that ey contact that he can make with peopl to convinc all american that we have to sacrific he lost no time todai in make clear that hillari clinton is go to have a major job at the white hous well thi is on of the great symbol and sign of gener and social chang hillari clinton top flight lawyer top of her class at welleslei and yale law school effect leader for chang in arkansa as first ladi of arkansa after all thi is what thei did in arkansa she ran the educ reform program sold it counti by counti in arkansa she not go to just have an offic in the east wing the tradit home of first ladi she go to have a big offic in the west wing and it wa made clear that she is go to be probabl the kei person in charg of health care reform now if bill clinton go to be the peopl presid he got to solv the deficit if he go to solv the deficit he got to cut health care spend which is skyrocket hillari clinton is the person who basic go to be in charg of that that tremend import both symbol and substant for how he go to run hi white hous you were speak of sacrific just a moment ago jack and on of the thing that he had to do almost immedi wa to sacrific hi nomine for the attornei gener job well that true and i have to tell you paul iv known zoe baird sinc the carter administr she wa in the carter white hous she wa in the justic depart at that time highli respect onli forti year old five hundr thousand dollar a year gener counsel of the aetna insur compani her be the nomine to be the first attornei woman attornei gener in the unit state wa greet wide by peopl as someth terrif for thi administr and then it came out veri in the veri begin of the hear that she had hire two illeg alien peruvian for domest work had not paid their social secur of cours and she had volunt thi inform herself in connect with the form she had to file when she wa name but she thought and peopl who on the transit team who had put her up for the job thought and presid clinton thought that she could surviv that but after two dai of realli grill question and a tough time on the stand from the senat of the senat judiciari committe it becam clear that she wasnt go to make it i think that she made the decis that if she did make it it wouldnt be worth it and withdrew at midnight last night jack the campaign peopl who of cours were not involv in the transit time that chose zoe baird were complain that you know the transit wa run by rich peopl who didnt know what the real concern of america were and in fact our talk show democraci phone line lit up over thi question why didnt thei includ bill clinton catch the polit signific of thi well i dont know but i talk to on of them todai who said it wa just a mistak we did not understand the what the reaction would be weve never had thi as an issu befor it wa a civil violat that she wa involv in not a crimin violat her reput wa tremend the presid himself kept encourag her after all even after the inaugur on wednesdai she wa at the luncheon the congression luncheon she sat down besid the senat judiciari committe chairman biden while she wa sit there jimmi carter came up the former presid put hi arm around her told her what a great candid she wa for the job presid clinton himself came up and talk to her and said liken her plight to the plight hi own plight dure the campaign said stand in there the stormi weather as you mention stormi weather but you can weather it and you wont be impair you can serv as attornei gener jack she had everi reason to believ that the presid wa behind her and that she could surviv it jack you said that she made the decis to withdraw on her own you know there some word out here that she wa nudg by the white hous by warren christoph right the man who had the secretari of state right head the transit and who is now secretari of state right publicli at the committe she wa sai it wouldnt be appropri for me to withdraw yet privat wa she wa the on who did it or not well let me tell you what my understand of it is from someon who i know veri well who veri close to her at eight oclock on wednesdai morn she first brought it up to the transit peopl herself and she said thi is begin to look like it go to be so controversi that even if i am confirm i wont be abl to do the job i wont be abl to make the justic depart independ restor the integr to it and then later even brought up that well look if we have republican against me where will the bipartisan justic depart be and final after that gruel dai yesterdai thursdai came out out of that meet went into a meet with lawyer and said i cant do it i dont think that if i even if im confirm i could serv told warren christoph that and warren christoph agre with her didnt get a push call the white hous the white hous readili agre but she wa the on now you might sai could she read the handwrit on the wall who know mayb so but she made the decis there no question in my mind about that and she did on the basi of if she were confirm she couldnt do the job on the second dai of a populist presid that mai live forev in reput in how chang it is were get so insid washington that i can bare follow it for us <unk> wa thi for outsid the beltwai yeah okai for us outsid the beltwai type i onc wa out there did thi event damag clinton well i in ani particular wai well ill tell you what i mean some peopl think it damag him tremend i do think it damag him some it will not have damag him veri much becaus you know it got stop in a pretti big hurri but if he ha anoth nomine up there and he doesnt stand up for her publicli now he stood up for zoe baird in talk to her but he did not mount a defens for her there wa no polit team there thei didnt have ani polit strategi to save her she wa actual left out hang by herself if you want to know the truth about it and she did pretti well consid jack there ar some peopl who think she mai that the presid clinton mai go back for exampl to judg patricia wald here in the district i mean who ar you hear that he go to go to now i doe it have to be a woman and doe it have to be a woman i doubt that it ha to be a woman thi time i doubt that serious ill tell you the name i hear drew dai whose a minor a black that wa head of the civil right divis in the justic depart iv heard of as a matter of fact three white male u s circuit judg richard arnold of littl rock friend of clinton rhode scholar jim neal famou trial lawyer prosecut some of the waterg defend or tri them at least charl <unk> a waterg prosecutor who incident oper from a wheelchair iv heard of those as be talk about and i dont think he necessarili ha to go to a woman well regardless of who the choic is he obvious go to look at the situat with painstak care thi time right and he said that becaus the messag from capitol hill on thi nomin thi week the messag which the senat sent to the white hous wa mr presid you shouldnt risk your power and prestig on a fight which you mai not be abl to win yeah i think it interest on slice of thi whole affair to realli look at is the relationship between the congression democrat and their new presid and i think the gener feel on the hill thi week wa that the damag control oper went a lot better than the select process you know of the nomine that you had a presid who wa not georg bush ask hi republican to go out on a limb for john tower the ill <unk> nomine for secretari of defens and he wasnt jimmi carter who capitul to the hill even befor inaugur dai and pull the nomin of ted <unk> for c i a director bill clinton wa a gui who sent up somebodi he like and respect and when word came down from capitol hill thi week particularli after a democrat caucu behind close door democrat had a session and thei went around the room and thei said all right what about it and a lot of gui stood up said and women were not sure about thi nomin the word went back to the white hous the senat major leader georg mitchel wa in constant contact with bill clinton himself the senat judiciari committe chairman joe biden wa talk to the congression liaison peopl and to the presid when the phone call start come in on the hill and thei were about issu of class and race and peopl got scare the white hous knew what wa go on zoe baird had becom someth you dont want to be in washington she becom a polit nomine without a polit constitu and bill clinton wa too much of a politician to stand by her he final said thi wa it becaus the gui on the hill as paul said said you dont want to wast your chip on thi on if you <unk> but zoe he doe get some polit mileag gloria that gloria im sorri exchang the name im sorri that all right anywai he doe get from some peopl a lot of polit minu point for not stand up for her howev have put her up there well you know there a coupl of lesson here on is youv got to be organ in pick your peopl and two if you realli want your peopl to stai there the white hous ha a wai to do it there wa no organ the wai there wa that right but sai for clarenc thoma or that right but that kind of thing and the question is wa the white hous staff prepar to handl thi in the end the white hous didnt want to stand by zoe baird so she wa out there all alon but let also make the point that thi realli did touch a public nerv on two count the first count wa that there were a lot of peopl who felt that highest law enforc offic in the countri should not be someon who had violat the law and the second point wa that there were mani peopl who felt that there wa an issu of social class here that if you were privileg and rich enough you can skirt the law well it wa interest at first a lot of senat were skeptic about the phone call thei thought that thei had been orchestr by group who were against zoe baird like ralph nader for exampl who thought she wa too conserv then when the call realli start come in on senat said to me you know im get phone call from poor peopl who ar sai thi is a rich person problem gloria or she wa hire peopl to take awai my job these were realli peopl out there that the problem for thi administr becaus thi is suppos to be a populist administr care about the peopl well the peopl were call in and thei were nineti percent against zoe baird so thei had to listen both the member on the hill and down at the white hous gloria he bill clinton campaign sai im for the peopl who work hard and plai by the rule all the democrat at the convent cheer that line right but my understand is that for the most part and until veri recent the democrat on the hill didnt have ani sens of thi either i mean why is it that thei didnt have ani better fingertip feel for thi subject than the transit offici did well i think there ar lot of democrat who would tell that when thei were told about thi thei said what dont you realiz thi is a polit problem some of them were not as clu into it but a lot of them have said to me yeah we told these transit peopl that thei need to pai a lot of attent to thi more than thei did let us note in pass that mr clinton did get all of hi other nomin thei sail through the senat without ani difficulti whatsoev absolut and had ethic problem and a few had ethic problem but that is no mean feat either that is no mean feat exactli final we should sai though despit these troubl that weve been talk about that as <unk> go charli thi on wa pretti good thi on wa amaz and thi great insid washington incid that ha an ethic overton realli wa kind of on of the smaller item of the week in term of what wa happen to our countri it seem to me eight hundr thousand peopl gather between the capitol and the white hous for an inaugur that the most peopl that ever gather for anyth around here georg bush had three hundr thousand peopl at hi inaugur ronald reagan the most popular tiger weve had in modern time had five hundr thousand peopl let try to get a measur here eight hundr thousand peopl came from somewher to be present for thi i it wasnt just a mass of peopl i talk to a lot of them i can tell howard wa among them you all probabl were thei were enthusiast peopl thei were of all color ag type thei werent that interest in polit thei were good spirit thei had hope thei talk about hope there were no demonstr around there wa almost a <unk> in thi crowd in a crunch the subwai were jam you couldnt move and there wa a <unk> with these peopl it wa almost too good to be true i talk with them thei were hope ideolog almost none knowledg of the insid work of zoe baird utterli beyond their interest thei were interest in the ethic of it and the on thing i heard all of them agre on let whatev wa right here let dont have an attornei gener that stood in that line that all i heard there but what thei want wa chang eight hundr thousand peopl were drawn by the sens of chang after about a quarter centuri of on parti govern and everybodi tire of washington thi crowd kind of anti washington and pro clinton but not devot interest in chang and thei came with their famili and their friend and more littl kid than i have ever seen clinton knew what wa up he like it so much that he wasnt even late to the swear in and he made the shortest speech of hi entir life charli sometim in thi great pageant almost paradox we lose sight of the man who becom presid of the unit state yeah he just becom a figur at hi own pageant yeah what about clinton himself i mean i wa struck by georg bush by the wai had peopl into the white hous four year ago but thi seem to i mean c span carri thi live for hour after hour six hour bill clinton wa in there you know kneel down when littl kid came by to talk to them how do you think he he seem to revel in thi thing and he he so natur at it you cant believ it yeah he seem to be a kind of nation host he is a host and he good with the kid and he care about the kid and he got down there with hi ey where their ey were and he talk to peopl watch him is what matter in the ag of televis in a wai sad to sai more than how he treat on kid it fascin to watch a man at peac and as of on with the peopl littl kid old peopl i dont know whether he go to be a decent presid but he incred with kid with and with the women the men he wa remark to watch as he wa at the econom confer here it wa more even but there wa on exchang that show he ha a perfect face i didnt know what thi woman said but todai someon pull it up as thei sai in the sound busi a woman came through the line and i wrote thi down she said mr presid i want to tell you that i have found a new energi sourc she wa perfectli seriou iv found a new energi sourc and it will cure two third of the deficit besid have militari and industri <unk> and clinton did not sai well you crazi <unk> he did not sai ooh he said let me have some more materi on that thank you veri much and hell read it i it wa wonder he will read it i think or hillari will read it i think we might note in pass too that i felt that georg bush left offic with a great deal of class and grace i mean he displai a wonder warmth and friendli toward the clinton it had to make you feel better about georg bush and it had to make you feel better about the countri and our tradit when clinton came on that platform bush welcom him on the platform shook hi hand and a pat thei pat each other <unk> when he finish hi speech bush shook hi hand pat him some more when bush went to the airplan i mean to hi helicopt clinton walk with him and thei had almost an embrac you just had to feel better about whatev system it is weve got here and these two gui weve all watch and particip in thi week and now we clearli have to becom adjust to the clinton style and the question id like to put to all of you is how he realli go to chang the old town is he inde go to give us a new washington well he go it go to be more intim i dont think there ani doubt about that peopl make joke about the hug and the hog call from arkansa and so on but thi is a gui who im sure will go up to the hill dont you think gloria yeah i think hell probabl do it the wai he did back in arkansa too much he will in a wai try to turn washington into littl rock which is a citi of on hundr seventi five thousand make it intim make it familiar make it <unk> in the old style he go to be connect not just with the peopl he see but weve seen someth from everyth from the wai he campaign on talk show and on all kind of crazi show and how he handl those peopl in the white hous were go to have the first <unk> era televis presid who realli is deal with everi american in a fairli forthright wai he mai rise or fall but he go to have taken hi full shot i wonder though whether that isnt go to make us all a bit more self consciou and mayb that a good thing but thi clinton administr talk a lot about ethic and it talk a lot about the to the peopl and i think peopl in washington ar think differ in mani wai that why zoe baird becam such a victim becaus given thi new emphasi on ethic and what the real peopl in the real world realli think your suggest that he could rais the standard of washington yeah mayb i mean well be more self consciou about it and that aint bad well i dont want to be the onli on no go ahead who seem to have a littl bit of a <unk> note here but you know there were peopl who got confirm in thi administr who did have somewhat ethic problem there youv still got that to deal with we have a problem right now at the white hous of where were get less access actual in the press is after two dai well after two dai yeah now theyv shut that right theyv shut them off and so you know youv got i think youv got to wait and see how thi administr shake down befor you think that it go to be you know a renaiss or whether there go to be ani great chang it mai be listen it mai be polit as usual if clinton for exampl doesnt go for campaign reform like he said he wa go to do earli on id sai itll be he got a lot more ill sai itll be busi as usual there ar two <unk> note on would rais on is thei have a veri manipul mayb even arrog attitud toward the press thei think thei can go straight to the peopl over their head through televis the other thing is zoe baird is import symbol becaus thei didnt understand what the peopl thought about that and we should rememb that well what i think about is that thi show is come to an end but i rememb a headlin in the washington post thi week that said what we realli had wa a festiv of hug and hope and well be here to a lot of hug and well be here to keep an ey on the man from hope arkansa that it for thi edit im paul duke,

what happen well i wa appli for a job i want to move to portland i wa live in salem at the time and i call the senat offic becaus i had heard through the grapevin that he wa try to increas hi staff and after a few dai the senat himself call back and said that hed like to meet me and to get some write sampl and that hed like to give me some inform and ask me to do a draft of a speech so i arrang with him to meet and it turn out to be how old were you then how old were you about thirti all right and we met in a motel at the edg of salem and at that point i wa feel a littl awkward but noth happen i got the inform that i need and then over the next few week i talk with him sever time and then we arrang to meet on the coast in oregon at the <unk> confer which is a republican confer as it turn out that again wa in a motel room and i wa the onli other person there and within a few minut did he suggest your come to the hotel room ye thi wa hi idea all right ye and we never got into a discuss of ani of the materi i had written or brought with me he veri within a few minut start chase me around the tabl and grab me and kiss me and then i just got out as fast as i could the senat as im sure you know ha suggest that the mistak which he himself describ at on point as be inappropri were when hed had too much to drink had he been drink that night no not that i rememb and had you done anyth to lead him to believ you want him to chase you around the tabl and kiss you i dont think so not as you would defin it there have been peopl who support him who would sai that all of the women or mani of them who have come forward now and made these charg ar do it with some polit motiv how about you i had liter forgotten about the incid until the washington post report call in octob my life wa fine befor all thi start i had no reason to go after him how did the post report know did you tell peopl friend about it at the time you must have told somebodi if the post got hold of it ye well i came home in shock and i told my now husband and i told oh as it turn out at least ten other peopl and it wa on of those thing where we talk about it for a while and then we just all kind of forgot about it and then i move awai so it just slip out of my mind so when the post report call and said did someth like thi ever happen to you and it came back i said ye and then i told him the stori and then he said we mai come back to you and ask for corrobor and at that point i call up the peopl that i rememb be close to at that point and said do you rememb thi and all of them rememb in vivid detail which surpris me sinc it wa so long ago ar you go to testifi befor the ethic committe if thei call you or have you alreadi talk to them on januari nineteenth i met with two staff attornei and a privat investig on the ethic committe staff and gave them my stori again and im suppos to get a copi of the testimoni to go through and then send back to them sign and at thi point i havent gotten that testimoni yet we mai have to come back i dont know you sai youd forgotten about it yourself for year it must then not have been a horribl <unk> event no i mean it didnt scar me obvious it wa just iv never had that happen befor when i thought i wa go into a job interview iv never had that kind of experi befor or again is it the sort of experi he should lose hi job over if it were just me id sai no but when you have such a pattern of inappropri treatment toward women to me it realli sai someth about how he view half the popul in hi state certainli sinc the senat ethic committe decid thei would emploi the rape shield law in effect tell senat packwood he cannot bring up the sexual histori of the women whove accus him it someth he had earlier suggest he might do in hi own defens sever more women have come forward do you believ that there ar still more women than the twenti three whom weve heard from women who ar afraid to come forward for whatev notorieti it might bring to them or discomfort i person dont know of ani beyond that it would just be conjectur im in philadelphia so im so far awai im not like to run into women who have stori you know some gui just ar sort of sexual <unk> and their antenna doesnt work veri well figur out who recept and who not is that someth that the govern either should or will be write rule about as thei hear thi case well if it ha an impact on a job situat ye i think it is appropri for there to be rule and thi again is where you see the pattern unfold ye ye what peopl do in their privat live is anoth thing but when it ha an effect on relationship in the workplac ye i think it is appropri to make rule about it your in philadelphia which is not the same citi as washington it is wide thought here that power is a great aphrodisiac and capitol hill is full of veri pretti young women some of whom ar recept to senat and other in power who approach them sexual do women help confus the signal that men get ye it true and im sure some women have becom veri power by the relationship that theyv form i think it too bad that it is i thank you jean mcmahon when we return a lobbyist on women issu who sai packwood should resign and an oregon activist who sai the senat is not get a fair hear dont go awai in the senat ethic committe well have a full hear there the ethic committe mai be close a lot of oregonian mai not be abl to hear your explan dont you deserv the peopl in thi state an explan well that im go to respond fulli and fairli to the senat ethic committe and i think i mean these ar charg of violat the senat ethic rule and that where the hear ought to be welcom back to larri king live jane <unk> is execut director of the women campaign fund a major polit action committe that ha been heavili critic of senat packwood and want him to resign and in the senat home state of oregon we ar join by jeanett slepian a former aid to senat packwood who now head oregonian for a fair hear thank to the both of you for be with us thi even well start with jeanett out in oregon why do you think he not get a fair hear regrett thi is often the wai it is if your a public figur someon make charg thei ar wide report well i think mari in your comment in your interview with jean you indic that we have heard from twenti three individu make alleg against the senat and we realli havent heard from twenti three individu of the twenti three alleg against senat packwood thirteen ar from anonym individu of the ten who have identifi themselv two have said at thi point thei do not plan to testifi and that leav eight individu who at thi point we believ mai be will to testifi under oath and have relev cross examin as to the wai thei rememb the stori it is veri difficult and i would ventur to guess that there ar veri few american who would toler be accus by anonym individu accus mani of which were solicit by an eight hundr number which wa set up for the sole purpos to solicit alleg anonym alleg design to take your job awai anonym to the public or anonym to the senat ethic committe or both well at thi point thei appear to be anonym to both it veri difficult to expect anyon to fight defamatori statement which ar report by some area of the media as the gospel truth when you dont know who your accus ar it a fundament <unk> of our whole judici system in thi countri that everyon ha a right to confront your accus and when those individu when the major of those accus individu make alleg against the senat remain anonym it is veri veri difficult to do that i think that the best wai to character the stage we ar at now is sexual misconduct alleg ar to the nineteen nineti what <unk> with the communist parti wa in the earli nineteen fifti and in thi regard mari in the nineteen fifti peopl were accus oftentim <unk> accus of associ that were on or two decad old let get jane <unk> in here why do you think some of those women ar anonym well sexual harass even in the post hill slash thoma era is an issu that been veri clarenc thoma you mean ye that right a veri veri difficult issu to bring forward and discuss and on of the reason frankli why i and so mani of the peopl in oregon support packwood resign is frankli for a due process reason you know we talk a lot about the due process of the senat but i think it also import to talk about the due process of the women and also the due process in the right of the voter of oregon and frankli thei ar without a senat senat packwood while onc a veri good and effect senat a good friend of the women commun is no longer effect he cannot return to hi home state with do you think he stole the elect he knew the post wa look into thi befor the elect and misl oregon report about thi absolut you can stole the elect li to the elector there isnt ani question that prior to hi jane id like to jump in here let me just id like to jump in here well let you in in just a moment jeanett o k the washington post in novemb print a stori that three week prior to the elect thi senat deliber tri to cover up the alleg of sexual harass he li to the oregonian regard the investig by the washington post and frankli the onli justic and the onli realli just wai that thi can be <unk> is for him to resign and for the voter to have a fair opportun to select their senat base on all of the fact take it jeanett i know you do not think he stole the elect ye i think that we have reach a veri sad state in our countri when on the basi of alleg onli we would demand that a person job be taken awai that either thei resign the job or it be forcefulli taken awai on the basi of alleg onli that have not been <unk> to in a forum where someon can testifi under oath and be subject to cross examin it is shock to me in thi state we have a member of a former of the suprem court a former member of the suprem court who abov all els should be protect the fundament right of all citizen to a full hear under oath and for that individu or jane or anyon to sai becaus thi is a polit correct issu of sexual harass and by the wai if youll notic that everyon now ha back awai that no alleg against the senat rise to the legal test of what sexual harass is thei ar now be character as sexual misconduct not sexual harass but on the basi of those alleg onli that were go to take hi job awai and that is a sad state in our histori and realli <unk> back to the fifti and the mccarthi dai when famili job and career were destroi on the basi of alleg onli jeanett as you know the senat ethic committe now will also be look into whether or not the senat inappropri us some of hi govern paid staff in ani effort to intimid wit in effect scare them awai from the ethic committe hear do you think that might have someth to do with why some of the women who ar accus ar anonym no and i have no comment and no knowledg in term of staff or campaign staff it my understand that the number of individu that were involv in gather on twenti four hour notic jane not three week notic the senat wa present with alleg by the washington post on octob twenti ninth alleg by seven individu and he had never seen those alleg prior to octob twenti ninth he wa given twenti four hour to respond and he is and it my understand that mani member who work dilig were campaign staff member at that time and i must comment here that it is an absolut <unk> for anyon to sai that the senat in hi comment back to the washington post smear those individu the senat ha not releas those comment neither ha the washington post the onli thing that ha been said well the washington post jeanett ha said that someon from senat packwood offic fax them inform about some of these women sexual histori involv presum person other than packwood the character accord to the washington post stori said that some of the inform that wa present to the washington post contain inform that mai be potenti embarrass to the individu howev embarrass inform doe not mean that an individu is smear and sinc when in thi context the senat is basic in the role of a defend and what we ar sai here is that the defend ha absolut no right to try to defend himself in ani context becaus were deal with thi sexual thi polit correct issu of sexual misconduct those statement have not been releas either by the post or by the senat and for juli williamson or anyon to character them as ly or smear it ha got to be smoke becaus we simpli havent seen them and it my understand the senat ha no intent of respond were quickli go to let jane in here go ahead jane i think were lose sight realli of the larger issu we have a senat here who at on time serv us well he is now liter unabl to function he is unabl to serv hi constitu he unabl to be an effect leader on the veri issu for which he been elect he is a unit state senat we ar not talk about an ordinari citizen he ha been charg with alleg sexual harass by twenti three women mani of them sign sexual misconduct jane not sexual harass mani of them sign affidavit thei have been brave enough to come forward we saw on woman veri graciou woman come forward and talk with us tonight the voter of oregon the bottom line is thei do not have a unit state senat thei ar be disenfranchis were go to take a break but weve got lot more to talk about well be right back thi is larri king live in washington senat packwood wa realli a leader on women right issu and now we know that thi realli <unk> a pattern of sexual predatori behavior over the cours of time that he serv as our repres in the u s senat we have alwai maintain that thi is not simpli an issu of sexual abus or sexual harass but abus of power welcom back as we continu talk about the trial of senat bob packwood and a question to jane jeanett wa sai that you ar hot on thi issu becaus it is polit correct to talk about sexual improprieti but isnt the truth that mani organ women group in washington did not <unk> him veri hard becaus he wa polit correct on such issu as abort he a defend of abort right if thi had been clarenc thoma or alan simpson or arlen specter accus of thi you folk would have been on him like a duck on a <unk> wouldnt you serious well i think thi is clearli on case where the washington women commun wa behind the curv and we realli didnt and behind the voter of oregon absolut we didnt realli see the graviti of the situat and didnt realli realiz how strongli the oregon voter felt about their own senat be charg with such seriou alleg but the bottom line is that it wa the local <unk> for exampl not the nation <unk> that call for hi resign the local now not the nation now but we were final you know realiz that the voter of oregon have the right to decid who is their senat not we in washington weve got a call from albuquerqu new mexico mari mari well let take the call first jeanett im sure there time for you to leap back in o k go ahead albuquerqu o k ye my question is do you think that it fair that congress pass the <unk> law and then exempt themselv from it jeanett do you want to take that on and then segu from there into whatev els you want to sai i think it absolut correct that e e o c law and all other law that appli to privat sector employe should appli to the govern employ and as a matter of fact senat packwood wa the first staff on the senat to have code of conduct offici creat for hi offic to <unk> and prescrib what behavior wa appropri i would also though like to respond to the issu of senat packwood leadership quickli pleas so we can get anoth call in senat packwood leadership in the women area i think that there is no other individu on capitol hill democrat or republican who ha been a greater leader for women issu the fact of the matter is that bob packwood ha led the fight for women issu and if we accept what the washington post said and jane seem to want to accept everyth that the washington post ha said in it total that it is total credibl then the other part that the washington post said that there were rumor about bob packwood in washington for year i dont accept a lot of what the washington post said but jane appar want to accept it so let accept it in it total jane women group then us bob packwood you need him you us him and the reason you dont need him now is that there been a chang of leadership in the white hous and the congress bob packwood did not betrai the women movement the women movement betrai bob packwood jeanett do you think that the packwood case mai increas pressur on congress to bring itself under e e o c law oh absolut and it my understand i think that thei will pass similar guidelin for them and that thei should be govern by the same guidelin that all of us in the privat sector have to live by let take thi call seattl washington go ahead doesnt a woman compromis herself by take a job interview in a hotel room id like to respond to that i dont think she had the job interview in the hotel room did she i think she had prepar some paperwork for the senat or a brief of some sort and that the suggest wa she bring it by there and thei go over it i think your question is well taken howev that perhap she could have suggest a restaur but peopl make mistak and perhap she thought she knew him better at least jean mcmahon is make her alleg in the appropri wai she not make them <unk> she ha testifi to them in a legal deposit and it my understand is prepar to testifi befor senat ethic that is the fundament judici process in our countri and for anyon to want to abrog it is wrong jean <unk> stori howev doe rais two critic issu of fact that will be subject or should be subject quickli pleas jeanett to cross examin number on she ha said that twice she went to hi hotel room and in her stori she said the second time she wa surpris that he wa alon the second critic issu that she did not mention tonight but did tell the washington post is that she wa not so traumat by thi incid that she did not call hi offic two or three dai later to ask if she got the job thi wa not a traumat individu as she now appar appear look back twenti year after the incid to portrai it let take anoth call <unk> missouri go ahead ye i have a question as to the anonym of these accus of senat packwood if you wish to abid by the law thi man ha everi right to us anyth relev to hi defens to prove hi case if it embarrass to them what do thei think it do to him we fought for the right to vote as women should we not stand up for hi right to defend hi civil liberti against anybodi anybodi who accus him of anyth jane again i think that were talk about and i agre we need to be talk about right and justic but i think we need to also consid the right of the voter of oregon and i keep go back to my initi point and that is that the voter of oregon do not have a repres thei do not have a senat thei do not have a senat that can meet hi constitu thei do not have a senat that can be an effect fighter for legisl were talk about someon who is a unit state senat someon who should be held to the highest standard that we can hold ani individu someon who should repres all of us in the optimum wai and clearli senat packwood behavior hi attempt to discredit these women ha not been <unk> with those kind of standard jane senat packwood wa the <unk> elect senat from thi state and he repres us quit <unk> he is now conduct hi second swing through thi state and he no let her have her sai now and is talk about the import issu that matter to thi state i think what import to look at here is that the genesi of thi stori start in the heat of a polit campaign the oregonian did know about thi stori publish a column about thi stori in march of nineteen nineti two the stori tell that last word im afraid is your jeanett were all out of time o k but thank veri much to our two guest jane <unk> of the women campaign fund thank you jeanett slepian of oregonian for a fair hear who ha join us tonight from portland im mari tillotson larri king live will be back in just a minut,

of the econom polici institut welcom to crossfir and happi april fifteenth incom tax dai no fun for ani american and especi no fun thi year for presid clinton who wa forc to start the dai by deni that he ha decid to propos a new nation sale tax to financ hi health care reform plan i didnt chang my mind i havent had a chanc to review it yet but yesterdai three member of the administr conced that such a tax is at least under consider the so call valu ad tax or vat is in effect a sale tax it would be in addit to state sale tax fifti other countri alreadi have a vat it a big monei raiser a three percent feder vat would bring in about sixti billion dollar a year economist have mix feel about the vat on the on hand by tax spend it encourag save and invest which we need more of on the other hand it heaviest burden fall on the poor who must spend all their incom senat minor leader bob dole doe not take thi nuanc view howev it couldnt be wors time were try to the presid try to tell everybodi we need thi stimulu packag and then somebodi drop a new tax idea out there that got to scare a lot of taxpay who alreadi frighten becaus of the other big tax packag well pat mr <unk> your group purport to repres work and middl class american thi thing would hammer them directli it would come right on top of the social secur tax increas it would come on top of the energi tax increas and mayb sin tax how do you justifi support a gigant new tax like thi well a coupl of correct the social secur increas affect the top twenti percent of recipi of benefit which not peopl who ar pai social secur tax at all it twenti five thousand dollar a year o k let call it the twenti five thousand dollar rich well the twenti five thousand dollar is not rich peopl in that situat ar not live off their incom theyr di save theyr draw down asset so their incom doe not reflect their consumpt but to get back to the main question the valu ad tax is about give and get a tax mean that peopl ar go to be pai someth but theyr go to be get someth in return if theyr uninsur theyr go to be get health insur which is worth a great deal suppos a work class gui if thei have health insur thei could save monei on premium and that would also defrai the cost for them of the valu ad tax thirdli the effect of the tax on low incom peopl ar <unk> in a number of wai and the govern can take step to allevi them further in particular insofar as the vat realli is pick up by consum becaus it increas price there an automat offset in social secur benefit which ar index to inflat so recipi of social secur benefit your tell me thi is realli a great idea i mean ar you go to here a tax that is like a nation sale tax which weve alwai been taught hit the poor and the work class hardest and your tell me it a great idea becaus it go to expand govern servic your on record in favor of the valu ad tax as the best conceiv im in favor of a nation sale tax if you get rid of the incom tax for work peopl so we can agre that the valu ad tax in and of itself is not an unreason wai to rais revenu so the question onli becom what ar we bui with thi tax if your against the new tax max what im ask it onli mean your against health care reform if your against health care reform your wai out in right field max im ask you why you ar pile on a new tax that hit consum your right work middl class on top of the tax clinton is propos and on top of the tax everybodi is pai on april fifteenth the tax clinton is propos nick the middl class the tax peopl ar pai april fifteenth ar due in great part to your friend georg bush who decreas withhold last year and now peopl ar look at a nice payment april fifteenth that thei wouldnt have otherwis expect you can accus pat of mani thing but be a defend of georg bush realli is not on of them well he endors him ultim over thi gui but he endors him all right fair enough richard <unk> nobodi like tax and i have real problem with a vat the problem is thi everyon agre that we have to do someth to insur the thirti seven million american that have no health insur how do you if you dont like tax if you dont like the vat what your where ar you go to get the monei well it interest that the free market ha work veri well in most other area in fact all other area of life and it the area we have most social which is medic care in thi countri where now we have the biggest problem and you sai what ar we go to do about the thirti seven million who do not have insur well if we had a more rapidli grow economi and if we had deduct so that most of these peopl could go ahead and bui their own medic care we could take care of much of thi problem look have deduct if you want to do it through the deduct the heritag foundat ha an interest plan in that regard but deduct cost monei where ar you go to get the monei to make up or ar you just go to let the deficit increas oh i can get the monei lot of place like we could abolish the depart of agricultur but you wouldnt want to do that no i do want to do that oh you do good how about the depart of labor food stamp not food stamp mayb get rid of the depart of labor the depart of commerc monei that busi firm spend on health insur for their worker alreadi escap tax so the problem is not the lack or presenc of a deduct it the fact that peopl have low incom and that health care market why dont we tax that too work least well of all privat sector market and that why the your sure not suggest ar you richard that the free market all by itself can assur that everi american can have health care and you dont need the govern in ani wai to help provid it nobodi even pat doesnt think that or did claim not to think that dure the campaign oh realli actual i like a voucher system for low incom peopl it cost monei doesnt it a voucher system like ani other system the real problem with health care is we decid we want to insur peopl from the first dollar now most peopl in most year have rel modest medic expens what thei realli need to be insur against ar the catastroph medic care and you dont have to have ani increas in the total amount of insur payment or govern spend on health care to do what need to be done look there ar peopl were do it all backward that the problem look it is a question of mathemat richard there ar peopl who ar not get health care now who ar go to need to get it we hope that bring effici to the system we dont have will ultim lower the cost for everybodi but meanwhil if you want to cover those peopl michael do it through voucher do it howev you want it is go to cost monei where ar you go to get the monei michael govern effici is an oxymoron a contradict in term so just do noth about it the wai georg bush and ronald reagan did noth for twelv year dont do someth stupid is what were sai asid from the revenu cost of the tax credit that your propos the fact is that if peopl were oblig to bui insur individu in privat market the cost to them would be <unk> and that on reason so mani peopl ar uninsur imagin that your out in the privat market try to bui your own insur and try find out yourself what the cost is and then figur out the benefit of a <unk> tax credit and look at the cost youll be face and youll see the basic problem with the conserv approach which includ <unk> propos to abolish the depart of agricultur it not seriou the biggest problem you have third parti payer so there is no incent for pick the cheapest and most effect health care system and if youv got govern or insur compani pai most medic bill which thei do nobodi is cost consciou about medic care so abolish insur compani no let get back to vat as i said most peopl can take care of the dai to dai medic cost it is the catastroph on we have to protect peopl against and for veri low let get back to vat you cant have co payment for a five hundr thousand dollar catastroph o k let get back yeah i know the natur of insur richard can we back to vat let get back to vat let me ask you thi dont you think if you take an energi tax and add it on to busi cost and then you take a vat tax and add it on consum ar go to pai the energi tax is veri small tini arent you go to go make the unit state of america far less competit than it is right now by do that well as i said the issu is ar we go to have health care reform or not if were go to spend new monei on health care why not cigarett tax the question is how ar we go to financ thi and if you need a lot of monei from a big new tax as you have said yourself among the conceiv choic a valu ad tax is not a bad tax well i said a nation retail sale tax richard im a littl confus by your posit here becaus i know a lot of busi lobbyist of which you ar on in fact your former boss at the council for capit format charli walker ha been push a valu ad tax for year and year and year it is a substitut for the exist incom tax and im all for a valu ad tax when we repeal the sixteenth amend to the constitut which gave the congress the power to impos an increas so let me get thi straight your in favor of a valu ad tax if it us to reduc the tax on a lot of rich peopl and their invest your not in favor of us a valu ad tax if it go to be us to bring health care for poor peopl im in favor of an effici and non destruct tax system and right now the present incom tax and i think most american agre with me after what theyv gone through to get up to todai that the exist incom tax is extrem ineffici it impos enorm penalti on person freedom and compar to pai ten fifteen twenti percent vat theyd have to pai to replac the incom tax well it the intrus o k ha bill clinton misread the mood of the american peopl on tax in gener and is he ride for a fall that question when we come back welcom back on april fifteenth tax dai in america the headlin tell us that bill clinton is think of a brand new tax a vat tax or sort of a nation sale tax to pai for the health care program that hillari clinton is work up ar clinton and clinton misread the mood of america or ar their critic behind the time our guest ar richard <unk> former chief economist with the u s chamber of commerc and now presid of <unk> and max <unk> of the econom polici institut max a polit question if i might do you think that first do you think that clinton would have been elect if he had laid out some of these tax idea dure the campaign and secondli given hi own respons which you saw at the begin of the show where he said we havent decid on that do you think thi wa a good idea to drop thi out polit i know you think it wa econom well concern the valu ad tax senat kerrei did quit well in the campaign by propos a comprehens health care plan which would be financ where he do well which would requir great new tax i dont know that kerrei wa specif about the type of tax but i think that in the campaign if clinton had put forward whatev thei end up with in term of a health care reform plan and acknowledg thi is go to cost monei that we dont have alreadi and sai were go to financ it with a valu ad tax i think that would have gone over well becaus part of the elect wa about reform of health care the valu ad tax is go to offset out of pocket medic expenditur by famili do you think he go to get it do you think he go to get the valu ad tax through thi congress he got to propos it that the first step yeah is he go to propos it i dont know if he go to propos it why would let me ask you a quick question why wouldnt he do i mean wouldnt you agre with a sin tax on cigarett you cant get enough monei from a sin tax to financ a new health care system you need a tax that ha the broadest possibl base and that is the valu ad tax the cigarett tax alcohol tax these ar small these ar nickel and dime oper in the grand scheme of thing didnt he contradict hi basic pledg i will not rais tax on the middl class for ani of my <unk> is he not contradict that as i recal in the campaign when he wa talk about health care reform there wa an acknowledg that to pai for some larg new program there would have to be new tax as there ar richard <unk> isnt it a littl unfair to pick on clinton as a <unk> as pat wa do when if you look at hi budget at the end of the dai a smaller percentag of the economi would be go to feder spend under clinton than went under bush or reagan the onli differ is ye clinton would pai for more of it instead of borrow it from the futur from the next gener well michael i find interest it took georg bush at least two year to violat hi no new tax pledg or read my lip now bill clinton done it what three time in three month he didnt sai read my lip no new tax he said were not go to get into that he wa forthright about what about answer my question i will not rais tax on the middl class clinton budget plan call for a smaller feder govern as a share of g d p than bush or reagan left us no and the onli differ is he would pai for it and isnt that a healthi thing to do to pai for it instead of borrow it your assumpt is total wrong if you realli look at the real number you end up with a bigger govern as a percentag of the gross domest product those ar your number theyr not clinton number well clinton doesnt have hi health insur in there yet i mean if you just take a look at hi own set of project you end up with more deficit in it took ronald reagan five and a half year to give the deficit that bill clinton ha promis to give us in four year well now look that a littl unfair ronald reagan took what wa not a problem at all and made it a horrif problem the problem get dump on bill clinton you dont think we had a problem in the carter administr ye we had a problem of seventi dollar billion deficit i believ or fifti dollar billion deficit which ronald reagan denounc and would he have love to have gotten back to those and would we all clinton cut spend in net term and that chang from the baselin in term of spend mean less spend and that mean everi penni of new tax in the clinton program reduc the deficit which is what peopl have been scream about now for five six seven year so the program reduc the deficit which is what peopl have been cry about the clinton program by increas tax will slow econom growth that a differ question well it not a differ question becaus you will get a bigger percentag of govern spend will be a bigger percentag of g n p at the end of the clinton administr than befor it havent we had a twelv year experi in sai cut rich peopl tax and well get and we wont increas the deficit it work it work you rais the capit gain tax and revenu fell we had that incorrect it is not incorrect capit gain revenu fell becaus you close the loophol you had an eight year experi which work veri well then we have began to have clintonom which start under georg bush under georg bush it most certainli did we all know that well clinton made what wa the deficit at the end of the reagan year remind me the deficit is not the import thing it wa on hundr fifti billion dollar it now three hundr dollar what wa it at the end of the horribl jimmi carter year it wa eighti billion dollar all right so reagan doubl it that well the economi larger so the deficit absent chang your focus on the program the problem is govern spend the absolut amount is not materi and govern spend is smaller what relev is rel to the size of the economi it will not get smaller michael well you can sai that but that what hi plan call for is smaller govern spend so your go to increas tax and have more rapid econom growth that absurd let me we all know it absurd thi is why do we have tax at all why not cut tax to zero borrow the whole feder govern would that be healthi or have on percent tax if tax ar alwai bad for growth we had nineti and seventi percent top margin tax rate in the incom tax for twenti year in the u s and we did quit well so but nobodi actual our margin tax rate ar so so <unk> you couldnt point to that record and then you peopl against all the loophol enabl peopl not to pai those rate i mean you cant have it both wai well max let me ask you the question richard ask you do have a i mean the b t u tax is veri heavi it tini hold it let me ask the question it less than half a percent of g n p let me ask the question max you can give the answer all right let sai two hundr fifti billion dollar in tax thirti dollar to nineti billion dollar come off thi new tax he propos over five year do you think you can hit the privat economi like that with new tax and it realli go to be energet and product ye becaus if you look at other countri with tax veri much higher than the unit state rel to g d p were at the bottom of the ladder whose economi have done fairli well not as great as us in some period but better in recent year than our ha that give i think us a good measur of confid that a slight increas in tax which is what involv here with the present propos even if you includ a big new vat a slight increas of tax by the evid of research that been done promis no harm effect on the economi and measur against what were go to get for these tax were go to get health care reform which is go to help busi iv got cut you off and iv got to cut you off too richard youll have anoth chanc when we come back though im go to try and get richard <unk> to critic a former employ think i can do it richard <unk> for mani year you were chief economist to the u s chamber of commerc the lead busi group in thi countri a lot of conserv republican ar veri veri annoi at the chamber these dai becaus thei sai theyr be too nice to presid clinton do you share that critic of your former employ ye but then let me get into what max said about the econom growth result from these tax increas is your pension vest i hope so nobodi believ growth result from tax increas nobodi said that your sai thi is a wonder perform let take europ europ ha the incom tax thei have all these wonder valu ad tax that you and michael want to impos on the american peopl thei averag ten percent unemploy in europ now the growth rate have been veri slow is that what you want to bring to the american peopl what about japan japan ha tax on invest of up to sixti six percent thei dont have a valu ad tax thei well im not for a valu ad tax and it got the exempt for save and invest thei have exempt for list stock thei tax invest far heavier than we do thei have a minuscul tax on capit gain no onli on list stock you can pai sixti six percent on your capit gain no you pai just let me get max back into the polit of thi richard let me get max back in here consid the opposit hi stimulu packag is get up on the hill right now from republican and the fact these ar controversi all these tax do either or both of you think that clinton tax propos b t u social secur especi can be stop and do you think the vat tax will go through well thei could be stop but thei could also pass theyr not tax propos theyr budget propos there tax which mean peopl pai and there spend which mean peopl get and the real issu is not just the pai side but the net what you come out with if you come out with lower health insur premium or you come out with health insur where you had none befor the valu ad tax is not a seriou burden if we get deficit reduct which peopl have been cry for for year and interest rate go down it go to sail through busi will be help i gather it go to sail through it not go to sail the presid ha to take the initi when he focus on thi thing i think he can ram it through richard iv got a total differ view there alreadi a group out there the american for tax reform run by grover <unk> that sign up on hundr ten member of congress alreadi on an anti vat caucu and given that and i think when other member of congress realiz thi is highli regress it go to hurt lot of folk it go to be an add on to the exist incom tax thei ought to be abl to defeat thi how can you sai thi is regress when you support replac the progress incom tax with a vat that ridicul no it not ridicul at all how can you pretend to be concern about <unk> when you want to replac five hundr seventi billion dollar which is collect in a progress fashion with a sale tax you can have certain credit against it to make the take awai a lot of the <unk> thei wont be but when your go to have you gui ar go to have to settl thi on off camera thank veri much richard <unk> thank you max <unk> pat and i will try and settl thi on camera in just a moment pat let me see if i understand your posit your not actual against a vat at all youd like a vat if it wa us to replac a lot of tax on thing like capit gain and invest of rich peopl your against a vat if it us to pai for health care for poor peopl is that about right i dont think it ought to be ad on top of the present tax at all i do think it regress i do think if you threw out the incom throw out the person incom tax complet as well as capit gain interest incom so take the as max wa sai get rid of the progress incom tax and replac it with the regress valu ad tax a valu ad tax youd exclud certain thing and then you would have a flat tax at about on hundr thousand dollar for wealthi folk sai fifteen percent put that togeth michael and you got a program that win america you gui ar go to your go to be pai a lot less tax under that and the ordinari american is go to be pai a lot more and you know it untru id be pai a good deal more i doubt it from the left im mike kinslei good night for crossfir but we all would be make more michael

22,498,hershei pennsylvania is an industri town that ha prosper sinc the turn of the centuri live off our nation addict to chocol more sustain than meat wa milton <unk> claim for an earli chocol bar but in nineteen oh seven hershei invent the kiss and it is still the compani biggest sell candi the <unk> kiss is on of the top five candi product in the countri account for more than half a billion dollar worth of busi everi year we went to hershei pennsylvania to see how it done the kiss is simpl to produc just a <unk> of melt milk chocol <unk> onto a move belt noth that <unk> ha done sinc as it creat new product fight to stai at the top of a competit field noth ha been as easi or as eleg as that littl chocol drop <unk> kiss tumbl out of a cooler that ha <unk> them up and jim santana watch for kiss gone wrong im inspect for the bad kiss everi hour i come back and i weigh them to see that theyr the right weight and then see that theyr the right size if that goe on the <unk> that would not wrap but what that would do thatll make the <unk> jam up out there and the women out there will realli get hot then from there to the wrap machin and the women who make the final check for nude kiss were told not properli wrap and onto to store the great success of kiss ha had <unk> specul for about twenti year on how to do what must come natur from kiss hug i guess it didnt take a rocket scientist to figur out after sell kiss for a quarter centuri or so that it would be a good idea to trademark that name and at some time wed find a us for it denni <unk> is director of market but while the name wa obviou the execut wasnt for year <unk> dreamer explor possibl someth that could be link to kiss product develop jim <unk> spent time on it off an on for thirteen year on of the initi on wa the donut okai that we thought we could you know packag with kiss you know and thei would kind of like go togeth you know donut on top of thi kiss that wa on that didnt get veri far hug and kiss and chocol ar sexi stuff but that on wa over the line also hard to wrap more think what if the kiss did the hug had someth insid an almond quickli we realiz there wa a difficulti in get an almond insid a kiss and our engin group work quit a long time on <unk> that we eventu did <unk> engin manag to add <unk> to kiss and the compani had it hug but a <unk> employe name lauri <unk> told her boss denni <unk> that for her it didnt work he recal that she said thi doesnt feel right thi doesnt feel like hug thi product it feel like it should be kiss with <unk> but you felt that she realli i mean when she said that you felt she might be right well she took awhil to convinc me but she wa veri persuas and on of the thing that realli i think convinc me wa her point that hug could be a whole <unk> busi it could have it own with <unk> and realli it wa that comment that kind of the light bulb went off in my head she right kiss with <unk> wa an instant success but that left product develop still in search of hug someth small easi to wrap that went with kiss and convei hug jim <unk> and hi colleagu tri teddi bear chocol barrel and a kiss shape with littl hand <unk> on it surfac you know the kiss were hug itself there were actual hand on the surfac like thi you know embrac the kiss itself i mean that where we were stretch thi we had hug we figur well put hug on those kiss hug itself and that would have been a manufactur nightmar we final came to the realiz that the thing that make the kiss shape so special isnt realli the shape it all the emot that goe into eat a kiss the foil wrap the flag the wai you <unk> it and the shape itself is a symbol for a lot of posit emot peopl have for <unk> and <unk> and holidai throughout the year when theyv enjoi kiss so after a lot of bang our head against the wall we came to the realiz that a hug in fact had to be shape like a kiss and now the question is what product it should be what should it ingredi be and then a breakthrough idea white chocol a kiss that isnt a kiss might be a hug a kiss cover hug with someth els thei made some kiss cover with white chocol and hand them around the compani it wa felt that the white solid white piec look a littl too much like hotel soap the answer wa stripe milk chocol <unk> the white chocol coat of a miniatur kiss it wa a clever concept easi to make by hand but tough to manufactur in the million if the stripe get too wide you get too much milk chocol past which <unk> the tast of the white chocol so <unk> thought thei had a hug but a hug is not a hug unless embrac by consum if thei dont like it we dont make it hug were a hit in test market hershei rush into product with a new plant and special design equip in august thei introduc hug an eleg chocol kiss shape candi but white with milk chocol stripe bite into it and it ha a thick white chocol shell around a milk chocol center it <unk> and wrap like <unk> kiss but the foil is also stripe candi analyst david <unk> of kidder peabodi sai it seem to be work earli indic from some data that iv seen and some folk that iv spoken to consum trial is run veri veri strong the real question and sort of the next wave after peopl have tri it onc or twice in the flurri of promot activ that accompani a new product whether there will be subsequ purchas the new hug plant is state of the art candi make were told apart from the wrap and pack we didnt see much we certainli werent allow to see the birth of a hug how thei slip that kiss insid the stripe white chocol is someth hershei keep secret we ask rod lot about it he wa engin project manag for hug the biggest problem we had to deal with is just the handl characterist of the milk chocol and the techniqu that we us to make the stripe so that wa the part of it that wa hard to come by i think the thing that <unk> everybodi who bite into on is how do you get someth that is made out of melt chocol into someth els that is also made out of melt chocol without melt the whole thing i dont think i can answer that we did get a hint the new technolog is base on exist technolog we ask the publish of <unk> magazin to take an educ guess elizabeth <unk> thought the trick would be the temperatur onc thei put the littl hershei kiss basic the embryo of hug on the belt my belief is that thei then put it through anoth what thei call an <unk> which is a piec of equip which ha like a curtain of chocol which then basic goe all over the top of the hug and the difficulti is to keep it stick to them you mean so that you dont melt the littl kiss part you dont melt the littl kiss and also so that it realli cover it evenli i see so it is a temperatur question my belief is that it is a temperatur question becaus you have to have them work togeth and that can be veri tough the other thing of cours about hug is the stripe ye and that again is a third process where thei have and i cant rememb what thei call it but it again like you would decor a cake you know with <unk> but veri veri fine i think thei call it a stringer and it basic veri littl thin string of chocol that it pass on a belt underneath thi and that basic goe backward and forward across the belt and put that pattern on it <unk> also think hug will be success she like it eleg hershei hope the combin of chocol will be like milk and cooki or coffe and cream to consum there is of cours an obviou question first kiss then hug then what the offici word from hershei is,

were talk about a sit presid the issu of infidel ha alreadi been judg by the voter why pursu thi stori for four and a half month well i mean bill <unk> and i ar about as uncomfort with those issu as anyon can be we spent month go over them and try to corrobor them and it not a pleasant task it not pleasant to ask peopl these question but we do think theyr import becaus thi stori and the alleg go well beyond infidel thei go beyond what came out dure the campaign and thei go to the heart of what the presid ha done in recent week to try and silenc these trooper to discourag them to keep out i think the most seriou charg in our stori hing on the presid call to a trooper offer him a job as a region director of the feder emerg manag agenc or a littl rock u s <unk> post and offer a job through him to roger perri in order to discourag them to keep out i think those ar action taken accord to our trooper by a sit presid and thei rais seriou question about just what it is bill clinton is try to hide and how far he will to go but bill go through bill clinton phone record from nineteen eighti nine see how mani time he talk to a woman and for how long honestli did you have ani qualm about do that and what do you think it realli prove well understand that we went to those record to corrobor the stori of trooper it wasnt to count how mani phone call were made in fact we didnt know we would find that when we look in it we were told by trooper larri patterson howev that we that he had been approach by aid to governor clinton dure nineteen nineti and told that becaus thei were worri that the press might get onto some of hi phone call to a girl to a friend that if thei did thei want the aid want larri patterson to take the blame to tell the press that he made those phone call that those were hi <unk> phone call and that bill clinton meanwhil would pai the forti dollar that hed run up in charg we were look to see if that would check out and sure enough not onli did we find all these phone record that show that he did make the phone call but we found the check that bill clinton wrote for forti dollar and sixti five cent with hi handwritten note on it for phone call sidnei we all talk about where wa the press when jack kennedi wa have all of hi affair isnt thi fair game thi strike me as a larg deliber distract i think that what we do know is that there a small far right wing group of peopl who through these disgruntl state trooper have put out <unk> salaci detail and through that have been abl to pull the string of the mainstream media in send them i think like mindless <unk> down blind allei to the extent that there ha been some independ inquiri into thi what we have found for the most part ar <unk> of these charg now i wish to add that not onli is cliff jackson involv who you mention in your earlier report who ha been engag in a veri long time polit and person vendetta against the presid but a younger right wing writer i hesit to call him a journalist david brock who written on anita hill and accus her of be part of a conspiraci and a <unk> charg that were veri convincingli <unk> in the new yorker my magazin by two wall street journal writer now in hi report he produc charg made by these trooper about the first ladi so call sexual activ theyr quit lurid quit explicit about her affair now either theyr true or theyr not true now brock ha said in the washington post of tomorrow that it pure circumstanti in other word more <unk> evid well <unk> it true or not were not here to defend david <unk> stori by ani mean were here to talk about what the corrobor that we have bill let me ask you becaus you admit quit candidli that you were contact on thi stori by thi cliff jackson that right thi notori clinton basher doe that in ani wai <unk> your stori certainli not cliff jackson wa a sourc of our stori last year on the draft but more than that a sourc onli goe so far a sourc make an introduct and that what cliff did he call me in fact befor the american spectat ever came to littl rock we were in littl rock we were down there befor there wa ani right wing conspiraci hatch but cliff jackson made the invest made the introduct of us to the trooper and at that point it ceas to be a cliff jackson enterpris it wa at that point a report enterpris and at that point we had to win the confid of the trooper and then we had to corrobor what thei had to tell us and if thei didnt if it wasnt <unk> there wasnt a stori that what we did next it wa an old fashion piec of journal look at record and talk to peopl hour dai week of interview and cliff jackson had noth to do with that that wa two report from the lo angel time gentlemen we have to break in here but when we return i want to ask you all about just how strong the evid is on some of the major alleg and also what some peopl ar call hole in their stori and well be back in a moment and were back now with bill <unk> doug <unk> and sidnei blumenth doug i think you would agre that the two most seriou charg that you make in your stori ar on that clinton continu hi affair right through the elect and two that in the white hous he wa offer these trooper feder job in return for their silenc as i understand it your evid for that is just the testimoni of the state trooper correct ye by and larg it is it their corrobor testimoni of testimoni as statement of of in on case at least two state trooper and in anoth case in the most seriou case is inde chri the phone call and there we have onli the word of the trooper who receiv it against the word of the white hous but that trooper upon receiv those phone call contemporan describ them to two other peopl on of them wa roger perri who told us about those call initi and thei were subsequ confirm by the report who or by the by the trooper who receiv them and also he told them to anoth trooper and that trooper also confirm for us the substanc of those call as describ by the trooper who receiv him you know we ar talk here about the presid of the unit state i guess id ask why is that enough evid well it enough evid to put out there becaus there so much other evid corrobor the underli alleg that presid clinton while the governor of arkansa and after be elect presid wa have affair with women other than hi wife all four of the trooper we interview in depth over a period of sever month confirm independ that thei took clinton to late night meet with gennif flower and with other women on of the women thei describ wa the woman whose home receiv the telephon call and whose off who got the telephon call at those offic that wa for us veri import inform those telephon record when we came across those show that there is a relationship that bill clinton had with thi woman and the white hous when we question them on sundai night absolut refus to respond to ani question about that woman except to sai the presid call a lot of peopl how mani peopl doe he call at on thirti in the morn and talk for an hour and a half and then call back for eighteen minut a few hour later that morn sidnei blumenth i can see and chri chri well let me bring in sidnei blumenth at thi point i see your not bui thi thi is highli suggest but no proof whatsoev in fact the washington post thi morn report that the secret servic which wa around the presid elect presid elect clinton at the time that he wa leav littl rock when these trooper were claim he wa sai goodby to a girlfriend claim that thi wa untru the secret servic sai it untru accord to the washington post i dont think thei respond to thi particular issu well ye thei were and that in the post thi morn but there a larger issu and that is the question of perspect what we see here is a kind of geraldo effect where the press is chase <unk> down these allei and you have polit forc that set them in motion that get what thei want out of it thei creat thi kind of effect through the gradual slippag of standard and the press think it deal with fact but in fact there ar polit motiv and polit forc that ar behind thi that ought to be consid and it veri import that thi perspect be brought to bear on these question rather than think in a narrow wai let me get to bill on that issu i mean there been a lot of suggest that these trooper ar somehow the tool of cliff jackson right there been the suggest theyr in thi to make monei why do you think these trooper have come forward yeah yeah these trooper have come forward for no promis of monei theyv been paid noth theyv done thi at great risk to their person career and to their comfort in their home state and their hometown why i think theyv done it as a it a it an exhibit of courag not not some kind of manipul thei were troubl by what thei did thei have it a concern that ha <unk> over the month and year and i believ that theyv come forward becaus thei feel strongli about it not becaus theyr anybodi tool sidnei blumenth whether it true or not and i know you have your doubt thi is you know percept is realiti thi stori is all over the network all over the front page how doe the white hous plan to get past thi i have no idea what their strategi is about thi sort of busi i regard thi as a rather trivial busi you know the clinton rather painfulli and publicli discuss the difficulti in their marriag as their introduct to the american voter and the voter elect bill clinton presid what thi stori sai is simpli that it suggest without corrobor yet that bill clinton had <unk> affair which is someth he ha admit there ar other question involv here question about the privat live of public figur and whether or not it ha ani bear on their public perform and there ar the question then about journalist proprieti and standard you know let me respond to that chri if i mai youv got about

26,566,nineteen nineti three wa a banner year for stock and bond as the dow jone industri averag set some thirti record and interest rate tumbl but buyer bewar some sai investor ar pois for a fall where should you put your monei in nineti four well ask the expert tonight on insid busi welcom risk and reward that the classic trade off for investor and in nineteen nineti three million of american decid to roll the dice and take their chanc on stock and bond individu investor funnel billion of dollar into mutual fund as thei sought higher return than their local bank could offer and that help propel stock to record high and long term interest rate to record low but will the turn of the new year be more sober than <unk> for investor while mani expert sai thi bull ha just begun other warn of troubl ahead forecast a ten percent drop in stock price earli next year put david shulman in the minor on wall street we think nineteen nineti four will be a difficult year for investor harder than thi year more analyst sound like thi i think in nineteen nineti four well continu to see stock price move higher but i wouldnt expect it will be a veri dramat year for the market overal the wall street consensu can be sum up in what becom a clich cautious optimist but a number of wild card could divert the <unk> that ha carri stock twelv percent higher thi year perhap the biggest on is interest rate if the economi start to grow more quickli and inflat heat up rate will head higher that could siphon off the flow of fund into stock that help propel the dow industri to success record anoth wild card the investor themselv small investor came back into the market in nineteen nineti three in forc and that worri some analyst who sai thei ar more like to dump share at the slightest volatil but talk of a <unk> been around for some time and so far stock ar still at record high i think investor rather than jump off the ship shall we sai as time ha gone on theyv sort of adjust to these worri and these scare and sai look show me show me someth that chang then ill sell until then most analyst ar look for still more monei to flow into the stock market if onli by default with bank pai the lowest rate in year there arent a lot of altern when we come back ill be talk with two invest strategist about the outlook for nineteen nineti four michael metz from oppenheim and compani and ronald hill of brown brother harriman stai with us welcom back to insid busi by some account thi is the longest bull run of the centuri can the good time continu or is thi bull get a littl old join me now with the invest outlook for nineteen nineti four and a take on nineteen nineti three ar michael metz he is chief invest strategist of oppenheim and compani and ronald hill invest strategist from brown brother harriman welcom both of you thank you now as i understand it we have a bull and a bear here ron how bullish ar you cautious optimist here cautious optimist o k ye let admit the market had a nice run were in the fourth year of a bull market we onli have on of those on record sinc world war two that wa eighti six to eighti seven and so at high level of p slash e ratio low level of dividend yield you dont want to expect too much but still like the long term averag nine ten percent total return basi on the s and p five hundr probabl a littl better on the dow jone industri for nineteen nineti four look doabl to us o k what about you michael you dont agre with that do you no i dont i think as thei sai in the beer commerci it doesnt get ani better than thi i think weve had the best of all possibl world low inflat low interest rate and orderli busi recoveri i think both bond and stock market peak in octob i think it go to be a veri difficult nineteen nineti four translat that into number for me what is a difficult nineteen nineti four mean well difficult that the euphem for down i think if your an <unk> youll lose monei in nineteen nineti four ani idea how much enough to be pain id sai minimum of fifteen percent on the down side dure the year that a pretti good correct all right you obvious disagre rather substanti on the outlook let me ask if we agre at least on the sort of fundament analysi of what happen in nineteen nineti three am i right in sai that what we saw wa liquid we saw low interest rate drive peopl into the stock market and to a certain extent into bond as well is that correct michael i think basic that is the stori and the real question for nineti four is whether that urgenc to get higher yield from stock continu and in my judgment weve seen the low in interest rate for a varieti of factor and as interest rate move up particularli in the loan sector i think that urgenc to jump into stock wane and i think the stock market will suffer from malnutrit it wont get that mutual fund inflow do you think that interest rate ar head back up well i think i would look at the other side of the equat which is short term monei market rate the monei that come into the stock market be driven in larg part by peopl exit the c d market becaus thei just cant live with two and on half to three percent return from their bank i dont see that chang ani time soon the loan demand remain low the bank do not need monei there is no loan demand until you get a realli strong economi and the bank want to bid up for your deposit theyr still go to pai you two and on half to three percent and peopl ar go to get fed up with that so in nineteen nineti four you dont think american have ani incent to put their monei in the bank anymor than thei did in nineti three not at the outset thei certainli dont actual you saw a low point in commerci industri loan demand about two month ago it start to pick up on of the major reason that long term rate went down is that bank accumul bond posit to the highest degre in histori if you also look at the bank figur that accumul end about two month ago i think your see a switch so am i correct what your both sai to me is that you think interest rate for a varieti of reason will remain low unless and until the economi realli take off no that not my view i think interest rate have seen their low no i think the real question here is longer term rate i think short rate will probabl edg up a littl bit although my guess is the fed will probabl push short rate up in order to encourag the bond market long term all right so short rate ar not go to move much where you see the biggest chang come is in the long term end of the market that correct but that an inflat sensit argument and right now let face it metal price and the economi ar look quit strong but thei look wonder in the fourth quarter of last year also onli to get <unk> by a veri weak first quarter follow and i think you have a veri real probabl that the first quarter of nineteen nineti four is go to be a lot weaker than the fourth quarter of nineteen nineti three and that again take a lot of pressur off that it probabl take awai some of that inflat argument what do you think mike no i think the move in industri commod price is for real the major <unk> influenc ha been liquid from the commonwealth of independ state i think that run it cours michael what about oil price theyv been go down that help produc deflat ye but my point on there is that your probabl at the bottom for oil price and that alreadi had it <unk> influenc i think it go to work the other wai in nineti four so your sentiment is that were go to see a bit of inflat come and that go to push long term rate up ye but most importantli id sai thi for the market to go higher you dont have to have flat inflat have to have lower inflat in my opinion it doesnt get lower ron i think for the market to move higher you need to have stabl interest rate environ and rise earn which i do forese becaus i see econom activ pick up what i think is realli crucial is that the nomin level of econom activ doesnt improv that much it just that the mix get better there more real growth less inflat in compon there therefor i think the fed doesnt move becaus theyr realli <unk> i think on the nomin growth rate in the economi all right so were not go to see you think the feder reserv push interest rate higher at the short end number i thought i heard a point of agreement between the two of you there on on thing part of what been drive the stock market up is individu put their monei into mutual fund chase higher yield than thei can get at the bank what kind of investor ar these individu ar thei long haul player mike or ar thei nervou <unk> that the trillion dollar question we realli dont know becaus a lot of them were never in the market befor and theyr in there becaus of yield so i think the real question is do thei panic or chang their invest strategi or their asset prefer if thei sens that interest rate ar go up i think that doe happen and i think that a major potenti neg someth that could hasten the correct i think it would <unk> it make it happen faster in a shorter period of dai that right ye were not talk about a crash here no but i think we ar caught i frankli think your go to see a mini crash in the bond market i think trend follow there includ bank highli leverag posit by individu will sens the direct of long term rate as up again and i think you could see a realli deep deep correct in the bond market veri quickli now i know your not look for realli a correct in stock or bond too much ron but let me ask you if you think these ar a bunch of nervou <unk> first time equiti market investor out there i didnt us those term you didnt us them i us them i think thei ar peopl who ar not us to own equiti that is correct howev thei ar be forc into equiti and longer term financi asset becaus theyr go to live longer theyr learn i think through four oh on k plan through defin contribut plan from their employ that thei must make respons decis for their invest horizon and we live longer now and the fact is you cant go to bond at sixti and expect at eighti five to have ani kind of lifestyl rel to what you expect when you did that do you think the peopl who ar now put monei in mutual fund for the first time realiz thi do you think thei ar in there for the long haul or theyr go to yank their monei out at the first sign of ani troubl there will be certain peopl who will yank their monei but i think there a major portion of those peopl who ar in for the long haul and rememb a lot of that monei which is flow in through four oh on k plan cannot be <unk> anywai in a sens becaus you cant get at it until your fifti nine and on half at a minimum so i think that there is an incent there to stai longer term for some of these peopl and also rememb as long as inflat stai low own hard asset doesnt realli drive up your net worth quit as much as it ha in the past in the eighti for exampl and so were go from a regular low point of ownership of equiti up to i think a level that more like we saw in the sixti on fact id like to bring out is accord to the s e c survei of individu investor fulli a third of them think that their mutual fund invest ar guarante by the feder govern thi to me is a terrifi statist if your right about the market direct theyr go to be in for a rude awaken i think unfortun a lot of peopl who ar bui stock realli dont know the risk involv in it we need to take a break on that note right here when insid busi return im go to talk to my guest about intern travel not your but your monei stai with us welcom back to insid busi were discuss the invest outlook for nineteen nineti four i want to ask a littl bit about the econom outlook michael if your right and were look for a ten to fifteen percent correct in the stock market in nineteen nineti four what impact doe that have on the real economi that a veri interest question veri difficult on to answer in nineteen eighti seven the impact of the market declin on the real economi wa nil becaus the trauma realli wa restrict to a few hundr thousand margin player my point is todai you have million of peopl who will have a wealth effect who will feel poor if the market goe down so my feel is that a signific declin in the market would have a signific <unk> impact on consum demand in the real economi ron do you agre with that to get to your declin though wed have to have rise inflat which mean the valu of our home would go up again which i thought wa the kei in eighti seven becaus hous price didnt collaps and that where we had our sens of real net worth and consumpt actual pull back as hous price came down more than ani stock correct but you could make the argument peopl feel less good about the valu of their hous now and thei feel like more of their futur ti up in their portfolio but if your start to see your hous roll up again in price i think you know you begin to feel ron you can have inflat without hous price go up so your bullish on real estat your sai mayb skip the stock market and bui a hous no onli if hi scenario come true o k what is your scenario your look for stock to appreci modestli what did you sai mayb nine ten percent on the s and p a littl better on the dow right if that happen do a lot of peopl get wealthier and spend more monei thei dont it like thi year it doesnt feel tremend get right what your see is you know nine ten percent is not a spectacular golli i made a lot of monei in the stock market thi year kind of feel what it is is i made more monei than i made in cash and i feel a littl better o k on place where the stock market run up in nineteen nineti three help the real economi is it made it easier for a lot of busi to rais monei with initi public offer ron do you think that given your a littl bullish on the stock market here the pace of initi public offer will continu weve done on hundr twenti six billion dollar net here over the past coupl of year we did five hundr fifti billion dollar out from eighti three to eighti nine so were in the process of replac a lot of equiti we took out of the market in the eighti so i think there probabl more to go and i dont think that a neg and you think there an appetit out there peopl will <unk> the stuff up and also were replac expens debt for cheap equiti with cheap equiti for and were replac cheap stock with veri overpr stock in i p os o k i hear seed of disagr here explain thi to me no but the i p o market is realli a function of gener euphoria and gener market level if im correct and there a vagu chanc i might be that the market goe down in nineti four youll see that i p o market disappear complet and by the wai i think the big disast of nineteen nineti four ar go to be the i p os of nineteen nineti three realli you think so ye those stock ar go to suffer the most in the direct you anticip inde a lot of them were fad stock a lot of them in telecommun other area had no earn no dividend no real busi i think theyr go to be disast the high stock price in nineteen nineti three the rise in stock price also fuel a bit of a boom in takeov activ briefli michael do you see that continu oh ye and it takeov for stock rather than cash and you think thatll continu in nineti four even if the market get correct yeah there an industri rational for it i think it doe continu you agre so we can see the merger and acquisit peopl the invest banker can be happi about the outlook for nineti four at least let me talk about intern invest the big interest stori thi year ha been the tumbl of the tokyo stock market there been a real radic drop there it doesnt seem to have affect economi much in the rest of the world ar american veri expos to what happen in tokyo and doe it have ani financi implic for american or anybodi els i dont think it ha ani real impact for our market the big question mark is whether the japanes <unk> capit and sell their hold here i think theyr sell theyr real estat here make the bottom perhap but i dont think it the major neg no ron theyv alreadi sold most of the bond hold as well and i think the stock hold ar more longer term from the peopl i talk to in japan see big ralli in european market is that go to siphon a lot of monei out of the u s it ha alreadi but frankli my guess is were synchron for a world wide major correct begin in the first quarter of nineti four so theyr go to get it too in europ and southeast in my guess ye ron i still think there probabl anoth two hundr basi point to go on german interest rate on the down side europ float up on liquid and i think stai up on the basi of secular growth we have onli a few second remain michael first you and then ron you what the best place to put your monei in the environ that you expect gold stock i think gold will sell at five hundr dollar an ounc in nineti four unless it doesnt unless it doesnt here a hedg what about you ron i think <unk> sensit stock telecommun also someth to do with comput et cetera veri differ recommend veri differ bet well have to have you back in a few month and see who win if

35,731,from the futur of the presid health care plan to a shake up of histor the most power committe in the hous what would be the real fall out from a congress without dan rostenkowski join us from capitol hill with some observ wisconsin republican jame <unk> and maryland democrat benjamin cardin gentlemen thank you for be with us it a pleasur congressman <unk> let me begin with you assum there is a plea bargain work out and let just assum that there were would thi be an appropri wai to resolv thi situat well i would hope that if the plea bargain includ a feloni convict it would also includ resign of mr rostenkowski from congress why is that import to includ that felon dont belong in congress and were in a busi where a few bad appl spoil the whole barrel and if there is a bad appl in the barrel i think congress should take care of that and that why i have a resolut of expuls prepar so that if mr rostenkowski is a convict feloni he would not be allow to continu as a member of the hous congressman cardin ar you comfort that a plea bargain mai be be work out over thi whole affair well i think that someth right now between the justic depart and thei have to resolv thi mr rostenkowski entitl to hi right but he also everyon must be held account for their action so i think we should stai out of thi and let the the justic depart and the judiciari do what is appropri in thi circumst and we just realli have to sit on the sidelin and wait if there were a plea bargain congressman cardin do you believ it appropri for the final arrang to includ the disposit of whether that congressman rostenkowski remain in congress or not i think a lot depend on what the plea bargain is all about or how thi issu is final resolv there two aspect here on is the account of ani member of congress as far as ani crimin wrongdo and that must be held fulli account the second is how our institut need to proce and we the member of the wai and mean committe ar fulli prepar to move forward on the issu at hand and well do that but i think youv got to separ what go to happen in congress as to what will happen to ani individu includ mr rostenkowski as it relat to ani crimin charg can that be done congressman <unk> can you separ the two well i agre with mr cardin that the justic depart and the judici process should act first im just concern that the loop wont be close and a veri power member of the hous of repres who would admit to wrongdo as a part of a plea bargain would be allow to continu in congress and the american public wont sit still for that and that why the expuls resolut ha been prepar to close the loop if there were we had pass a resolut befor the hous that assum as the justic depart ha complet it work the hous ethic committe and the hous of repres will take up the post offic and ani ethic violat so sure we have a respons but it imposs to sai what our respons should be until thi matter ha been handl by the judiciari well a plea bargain is differ than even a juri verdict of guilt a plea bargain a member of congress admit that he did what is alleg in the crimin investig we dont have to delai with an extens ethic committe investig the congress out to do the right thing if the plea bargain doe not requir the member of congress who ha plead to a feloni to resign well your assum what go to be in the plea bargain we dont know that but congressman cardin what about hi point that a plea bargain is an acknowledg of guilt well it depend what he plead to we dont know anyth about what the plea bargain is go to involv obvious onc if there is a plea bargain we need to take a look at that and it mai be necessari for congress to take as an entiti to take action and we dont want to rule that out but i just think it veri difficult for us to specul until we know the circumst here i guess what i urg is that no on abov the law thi matter should be handl like ani other matter as far as the crimin proceed ar concern but when it come to the congress itself and take action against a member we need to know the fact first befor we sai what were gonna do congressman <unk> if the plea bargain if there were no plea bargain work out and if there were an indict of congressman rostenkowski what would happen at that point what should happen from your standpoint he would automat be forc out as committe chairman pend the trial and i dont advoc do anyth until the trial is over for two reason first the member is presum innoc until he is proven guilti just like ani other citizen of thi countri and second there have been case where indict repres have been found innoc includ the case of repres ford of tennesse where the juri found him not guilti and nobodi should be kick out of congress until the juri actual make a determin of guilt congressman cardin i assum you agre that correct in fact we have provis in our ethic rule to defer until after a crimin case ha been complet case ha been complet in order that that matter is handl first well also the congress ha got to be veri care that no matter what it doe it doe not engag in prejudici pre trial public that a defens attornei would us to try to get a trial move out of washington to someplac els or to dismiss the charg altogeth on the basi that an imparti juri cannot be pick i dont think that we should get involv in interf with the crimin process if there is a juri trial congressman cardin just quickli we have less than a minut mr clinton hillari rodham clinton said todai that if congressman rostenkowski were to have to step asid remov himself from thi process it would be an obstacl but that health care reform would still move forward is she right about that oh i agre with her complet our committe ha move forward on health care reform the subcommitte ha alreadi report out a bill the member of the committe ar commit to meet ani deadlin we need to in order to move health care reform so i agre with mr clinton congressman <unk> well these issu ar bigger than ani on individu in the congress of the unit state and the congress with or without dan rostenkowski will address issu that come befor it like health care and g a t t and the tax question that go befor the wai and mean committe is the reput of the hous hurt by thi whole thing gentlemen just quickli ani time a member of congress get in troubl all of us get hurt the institut and the member who keep their nose clean

from mr <unk> sp doe that refresh your recollect no sir it doe not i dont recal that meet you dont recal that meet at all not at all thank you thank you senat mack senat kerri thank you veri much mr chairman welcom mr steiner i know thi is the last place in the world that you ever imagin yourself be and under the circumst i know it highli uncomfort i know of you as other do as a person of enorm abil extrem talent moral idealist and i think that all of that leap out of your diari as a matter of fact i think your charact which i dont question i think you show the evid of your charact in your own diari in a number of differ place your judgment is good you see thing come you perceiv the danger you show the acumen that i think wa present in your be appoint to the posit that your in and inde you had the good common sens when georg stephanopoulo wa fire off steam and angri as anybodi would have been angri incident i think be honest about the circumst and your reaction wa you persuad georg that do anyth would have been stupid and improp in term of stephen and it cool down but that wa good judgment in addit you drew lesson you said that the lesson of all of thi is do what you think is the right thing earli recus you said rememb that everyth might eventu be ask about under oath dont let the white hous get involv in ani wai these ar all good instinct and inde you didnt draw the wrong lesson you also later on said such an incred citi been battl with r t c madison wrote two page about what been go on suddenli realiz i could be subpoena like packwood and the most innocu comment could be take out of context so on that subject noth and you didnt destroi your diari you left you diari we have it so i think there is in all of thi a veri refresh kind of truth almost innoc observ of the go on of washington and it therefor sort of troubl me a littl bit that you now want to distanc yourself to a certain degre or try to cast some nuanc on it though im not sure that that where your go i want to try to explor it a bit there ar five separ referr in your two extract to the subject of <unk> first you sai that should <unk> recus himself or should he stai involv you discuss the hurdl and that between the first month januari twenti fourth and februari twelfth then later on between februari thirteenth and twenti seventh so were span the period of about a month here you then sai for week we have been battl over how <unk> should handl the investig initi we all felt he should recus himself then you have thi the white hous sai it wa unaccept then you sai at the hear the <unk> amazingli did not come up with a sens of relief that thi great topic of <unk> didnt come up then you sai the next dai the new york time ran a front page stori the heat wa on we spent a tortur dai which ha been refer to by senat shelbi try to decid if he should recus himself again <unk> is front and center then all of a sudden despit all of thi tortur despit all of these week of discuss despit all of the pressur howel rain seem to be abl to elicit from roger altman what no on els could which wa a quick <unk> on the telephon and again the <unk> is sort of front and center now if you go into your prepar of all of the question for mr altman appear befor thi committe why ar you unwil to recus yourself and he answer the question or the suggest wa well i will not what is it i will not plai ani role in the r t cs eventu decis i will not be do so i will therefor have no role in the r t cs decis on the matter next you should still recus yourself why dont you as i said ill have no role in the r t c decis on pursu the claim these ar all phrase these ar not the actual answer these ar suggest but most of all senat the circumst ar such that ill not be plai ani role again doesnt your relationship with presid and mr clinton requir <unk> answer again be propos ill not be plai ani role therefor there wont be ani appear of conflict i am absolut struggl to understand why it <unk> be such a discuss why you spent dai on thi issu if he isnt go to have ani role if he isnt go to make ani decis if he isnt go to be involv then why did it matter whether he stai or not now youv said here there ar onli two reason for hi stai the preced and the guarante imparti how do you guarante imparti if your not go to plai ani role i believ senat that would be two question which i should address myself to first is why there wa so much discuss about thi subject and the second is how do you guarante imparti im sorri i apolog two question the first i suspect that i place more emphasi in my diari on thi subject than perhap other particip might which is to sai i thought thi wa an import issu and i continu to consid it an import issu after mr altman had made hi initi decis on februari third and so i suspect my diari reflect my own belief that thi wa an import issu but mai not fulli captur the emphasi or attent other peopl paid to it the second point that you make which is how do you guarante imparti if your not go to be involv i think mr altman had said repeatedli both to r t c and to treasuri staff that he want thi case handl in a complet imparti non polit fashion i think that how you guarante imparti well im not sure how you can if your not involv and your not plai ani role you cant know what go on to guarante imparti you have to make a decis you have to sai no you cant do that or dont pursu thi or dont pursu that if your genuin leav the investig up to <unk> what on earth wa there to remain involv for well senat i think mr altman sent out a clear direct ha to how he want thi case handl and that what execut often do thei mai give clear direct as to how thei want someth to proce and wa there ani indic from mr ryan or ms <unk> that it would proce ani wai than otherwis i dont believ so no senat then what wa the concern well i think the concern as i mention wa express by mr nussbaum i understand the concern express by mr nussbaum and hell be here as with other to explain it im just try to understand i mean i think your diari is veri refresh i think it veri honest i know you i know your honest and i know the ideal with which you approach thi process i think you have noth but the highest public motiv at stake and you know your the kind of person we need involv in public servic so i take thi veri i mean you certainli werent write the diari for the purpos of be <unk> were you senat absolut not but i assum you want to have the most accur diari you could have had didnt you i want to repeat senat if i could and im sure to write a precis narr or to give an exact chronolog of what took place over the past five month iv had to live with thi document and iv had to go and testifi under oath about exactli what i knew and exactli what i think occur and that what im try to do for you todai and well i appreci that my time is up i dont want to cut you off at all my time is up and i want to stick by the time limit thank you senat faircloth thank you mr chairman and ill go to mr steiner also and if you will pull that microphon real close and speak a littl slower ye sir you testifi that you believ roger altman wa candid with the committe yet you wrote in your diari that altman gracefulli duck the <unk> issu is it your testimoni that be candid and gracefulli duck ar consist senat i dont believ that he duck ani question about <unk> i dont believ he wa ask ani question about <unk> well what about gracefulli what do you mean by gracefulli duck the <unk> issu the allus here senat is not to the <unk> issu the allus is to question concern treasuri white hous contact and yeah meet of do you mean to tell me avoid answer question on the issu when you sai your duck is that what you mean senat as i said give me your descript of duck a question senat as i said i think mr altman wa truth in hi testimoni befor you is truth and duck consist in testimoni i think mr altman wa ask a question which he did not anticip and he answer in a wai that allow him to convei the inform in the clearest possibl wai that he could josh if i might what question ar you refer to that he did not anticip i believ he wa ask about treasuri white hous contact would it chang your mind if you were to know that the even befor in a convers with me that i had advis him that we would be ask him directli what contact he had and treasuri had with the white hous were you awar of that phone convers i had with mr altman no i wa not senat well would that chang your mind senat if i told him the even befor we ar go to ask you what contact you or treasuri or your staff and the staff of the white hous have had and your tell me that he gracefulli duck the question he knew wa go to be ask well senat let me i mean the whole thing is that he knew what he wa go to be ask he wasnt surpris and your sai that he veri gracefulli duck them so in other word i dont know make a distinct between duck and ly senat if i might if i were to describ that testimoni todai i would undoubtedli choos differ word what now if i were to describ the testimoni todai oh im sure of that i didnt laughter i never doubt that lord have merci i knew youd us differ word todai but you tell me the differ between duck and ly senat as i said befor i do not believ that mr altman li to thi committe or attempt to mislead thi committe i believ he spoke truthfulli and to the best of hi knowledg if <unk> not mislead duck is mislead now what doe ly do senat as i said i have no reason to believ nor do i believ that mr altman li to thi committe but he duck senat i think he wa ask a question which he didnt anticip in fact you kind of admir hi duck becaus you said he duck gracefulli rather than <unk> laughter i mean you know that nicer duck than kind of stumbl through a duck than to gracefulli duck mr foreman ye sir in your deposit you testifi about a convers you had with beth nolan who work for bill clinton in the white hous in that convers you said that you told her that there wa concern about the possibl of new leadership at the r t c in other word somebodi besid altman you said that the concern wa that the new leadership might and i quot come up with some off the wall decis rel to the madison civil case mr

them senat excus me were you stop i did not that wa not my comment from my head i wa pass on someth that i had heard wait a minut now what now who were you pass it on from to the best of my recollect ms hanson said to me someth like there wa concern becaus the other leadership in the r t c wa brand new in their posit and someon had express a concern that there wa no experi with the thorough and fair with which thei made decis and that wa the basi of the comment that i pass on to ms nolan well i would think the ethic director your somewhat of a judg your suppos to be sort of set the exampl isnt that right i would like to think so all right so you worri about pass on inform as to who might come up with someth differ from the would produc a differ outcom from what you all were hope for senat that not what that comment goe toward on of the factor when on look to decid whether or not to make a discretionari decis of whether to recus is look at the other peopl who would be make the

be the on make the decis about madison guaranti yesterdai we learn that ellen <unk> is regard as be a tough lawyer if you werent try to influenc the outcom of the decis or whether to file civil case in the madison matter why were you concern about a tough lawyer be the on to make the decis i wasnt concern at all about a tough lawyer make the decis that wa fine with me i had no view on the question of who would be make the decis my onli interest wa that somebodi had mention thi which is a factor relat to peopl who would be make the decis if roger didnt i person had no concern about that and as iv said befor i believ that mr altman should recus himself from thi matter bernard nussbaum complain to jean hanson befor about the choic of ellen <unk> the person who will make the decis in the madison matter nussbaum twice want to know how <unk> got hire without be clear by him even though the r t c is suppos to be an independ agenc the <unk> hous want to make the madison guaranti civil case take the case awai from ellen <unk> instead put the decis in the hand of robert fisk why would the white hous want to replac a lawyer that thei think is too tough with robert fisk were thei think

41,838,bori yeltsin still <unk> memori of hi stand on a russian armi tank defi the <unk> of a foil coup <unk> but he is also rememb as the russian presid who assault hi countri parliament and bar newspap from publish now some assess of bori yeltsin from three peopl who have studi him close british journalist jonathan steel write in a book call etern russia that yeltsin doe not provid the leadership that russia need steel <unk> yeltsin attack on the parliament last year to him it wa a case not of resist to <unk> but of yeltsin own inabl to compromis he temperament and <unk> and polit not a man of dialogu he wa after all part of the old communist apparatu he wa a region parti chief which wa a job where you tend to give order you receiv order from moscow then you gave order to peopl down the line almost like a militari structur you didnt realli have to wheel and deal with peopl on your on level who had power base in their own right so hi philosophi seem to be to destroi the power base of peopl he disagre with rather than to try and accept that it wa a perman featur of the new russia to have a strong parliament as well as a strong presid and to do the normal deal that a democrat elect presid ha to do even yeltsin admir admit that he <unk> in an authoritarian fashion but leon <unk> who work on a biographi of the russian presid think it the strong hand of a nation builder a russian charl de gaull build a rigid framework for a flexibl democraci still to come it the end process that will tell us whether thi is inde a stabil accomplish with veri strong inject of execut power from abov which will eventu onc the societi <unk> will remov itself gradual from the affair of the state or whether the process given the russian inertia will continu and yeltsin will inde try to becom an authoritarian dictat my person feel it seem to me that if there anyth he treasur about hi public persona it that he a democrat other find less to treasur about bori yeltsin public persona anoth newli publish apprais of yeltsin and russian econom reform is lost opportun why econom reform in russia have not work it by marshal goldman he a <unk> figur when he on there probabl not a better politician in russia and is some case mani part of the outsid world but when he off he goe into a funk he ha alcohol problem he acknowledg those on of the most remark thing is to read hi autobiographi it in the second edit and he talk about hi physic problem he talk about hi mental problem i dont ever rememb read about a sit presid or prime minist of ani countri who talk about how difficult these thing ar for him and allud to the fact that you know he had close to a mental breakdown and when that happen it terribl he wa just in germani just a few week ago and wa shown drunk on televis that not good for him it not good for hi countri it not good for hi peopl and the doubt arent just about person decorum author jonathan steel found a most tell exampl of what wrong with yeltsin leadership in on of the most bizarr episod of hi presid the currenc recal of nineteen nineti three well that wa a weird thing it just happen on a saturdai morn yeltsin wa out of town at hi dacha or mansion and it wa announc that everybodi had to turn in their monei by sundai night and it would not be worth anyth after that except those note that had been print in nineteen nineti three thi wa in juli nineteen nineti three so there were obvious an aw lot of note the vast major that had been print befor that it caus absolut panic but on of the thing that wa realli interest about it it wa not just someth that took the public by surpris but it took mani of the kei minist by surpris the minist of financ bori <unk> wa actual in washington when thi decis wa taken on the fridai night by the cabinet and hi civil servant as it were and hi colleagu in the other ministri who were also reform like him never pick a phone to washington to tell <unk> that thi incred thing is happen and i think thi show realli the veri <unk> of the whole russian system youv just got realli a veri small group of peopl without a proper civil servic without ani real backup without ani institut tradit of consult and contact each other and so these thing ar just complet arbitrari as for the success of econom reform under yeltsin jonathan steel <unk> there been a lot more shock than therapi so doe marshal goldman industri product he sai ha declin by half in just the past coupl of year there is no doubt that there ha been what mani russian ar now describ as the <unk> of the countri that ha been accomplish in part by lower the rate of inflat in nineteen nineti two the rate of inflat wa twenti four fold two thousand four hundr time price rose now inflat on a monthli basi is down below five percent so that an accomplish but it been accomplish in part by destroi some of the industri and also a lot of disguis unemploy and offici now it mayb four percent but unoffici us u n statist it come close to twelv percent which mai mean that there ar ten million unemploi some peopl sai fifteen so it a veri mix packag some improv but clearli a radic kind of chang not all of it for the best but to sum up what youv just said if inflat is run at about fifti percent a year or more and if real unemploy is about twelv percent and if the g d p the gross domest product of russia ha declin industri product ha declin by half over the past year and a half we would recogn that as be in a great depress if we were experienc thi right now we certainli would and that why there is i think concern about yeltsin polit stabil and the stabil of the countri both goldman and jonathan steel in their new book on russia conclud that yeltsin ha come up against obstacl more endur than communist parti rule cultur and histor factor that make russia <unk> to market econom and democraci leon <unk> who take a far more upbeat view of yeltsin in gener is also more posit about the econom progress he made first let see where he start in august of nineteen nineti on you rememb after the anti communist revolut august nineteen nineti on the predict were that russia would be visit by <unk> of biblic proport starvat civil war total disrupt of ani and some said that thei would be thrown back to <unk> where peopl will just be go natur barter exchang noth of that sort happen credit yeltsin there realli nobodi els to credit i mean the countri viabl econom nobodi starv but there is a plagu in yeltsin russia that everyon remark on corrupt is rife extort bribe take the loot of previous public asset here jonathan steel the degre of <unk> and corrupt now is so excess that it veri hard to find on honest man or woman there and i think in ani system onc the balanc tip so far in on direct it veri hard to get it back again if there wa ten percent let sai of corrupt and nineti percent wa honest busi gradual grow up then the ten percent might elimin down to on percent you think that an understat of i think i think now you know it more like nineti percent is corrupt and i think even more than that it the lack of invest there veri high <unk> consumpt by these new millionair theyr bui their merced car and their b m ws and so theyr put a lot of monei abroad in foreign bank bui <unk> and properti all over the world theyr not actual invest product in a new capitalist economi in russia and i think that the problem crime and corrupt as it turn out ar absolut endem to post communist societi thi is leon <unk> explan of russia era of good <unk> i think that ha someth to do with the sort of <unk> whale of the state economi that sort of ly there rot and the <unk> ar there pick at it and i hope that onc theyr <unk> theyll retir to florida or california which is where theyr bui hous at thi point and just leav the economi alon but marshal goldman whose specialti is the russian economi find russian corrupt and organ crime to be fundament differ from what happen in other formerli communist countri for me on of the fascin thing is that if you look at poland hungari or china countri which have also been communist and ar in the process of transit thei dont have <unk> so you have to ask yourself why why is it so strong in russia so pervas as it were and not in those other area and i think it partli due to the fact that in the case of poland when thei began their reform thei had mani privat institut eighti percent of the farm had never been <unk> and there wa a privat sector alreadi and when the reform began thei allow anyon who want to to go up and open up busi and so you had enorm competit and you had so mani peopl out there you couldnt get a group of <unk> togeth to coerc them there wa just too much activ and it just didnt make sens the same thing hold in china in russia thi goe back to gorbachev when thei began in nineteen eighti seven to allow privat activ thei allow veri few and those few who did made enorm profit and thei then becam natur target and the <unk> kind of just <unk> find it the main growth industri and so ultim thei now control all these thing and thei have a better tax system than the state thei have a better enforc mechan than the state thei bui out mani of the offici in the state and the fact that russia also had thi veri larg inflat in the earli stage meant that you basic destroi the civil servic and made the polic vulner to bribe and govern offici to corrupt on of the most conclus about yeltsin the russian and the state of reform come from jonathan steel in hi new book steel cover moscow for the british newspap the guardian dure both the brezhnev year and later in the gorbachev slash yeltsin era he is struck by yeltsin shortcom and equal by the wai the russian peopl respond to him for exampl <unk> without complaint in such high hand nonsens of the recal of all the old rubl note it show a kind of <unk> and an apathi and a hopeless if you like which is not veri good if your try to construct a participatori democraci but it obvious better that thei should be passiv than that thei should riot or tear thing down or go on the rampag or even go on massiv strike so i think in that sens yeltsin ha been lucki that he got a popul which doe seem to be veri patient but my fear about russia is not that there go to be some militari dictatorship or zhirinovski or somebodi like that i think it more than that therel be anarchi in the sens that the countri is becom increasingli ungovern so that it doesnt realli matter what parliament doe or what yeltsin doe or whether thei live in harmoni or struggl out like thei did a year or so ago the econom control and polit control ar just not there jonathan <unk> new book is call etern russia yeltsin gorbachev and the mirag of democraci,

do you make of the fact that two year ago it seem fair to conclud that the american the american vote public wa sai we want chang and now there seem to be at least a substanti portion of the american public that is skeptic of chang well ha the mood chang or just the wai we read a chang well chang wa the big motif of the clinton nineteen nineti two campaign and now the question is if he wa an agent of chang do thei want chang mayb thei said we dont want to chang polici we just want to chang a lot of face and get rid of all of those with known record and bring on those who have a virtu of have no track record of all if that is true it tend to favor the empti suit especi the empti suit with deep pocket let me ask the name colin powel of cours is newli promin in figur in the futur polit of thi countri he is certainli no empti suit doesnt even have deep pocket on the other hand he ha no discern record we read an articl yesterdai or i guess on thursdai in the intern herald tribun where he

veri interest articl that steve <unk> found in the herald tribun and inde it certainli take gener powel a lot further than he yet gone anywher that weve seen in the paper back in thi countri there he wa at a dinner of all place at the frankfurt germani book fair and he quot there as sai that futur servic might be polit and he might accept a nomin and that he begin to get us to the feel of be elect how about that and that he hasnt yet develop a polit philosophi becaus he hasnt need on so far and that of cours is interest and then he that about as far as he gone to sai that he avail as a republican as a democrat as an independ or what ill tell you with the gener alien of american about ar establish parti the field wa now never more fertil for an independ and it seem sinc american seem to be turn off on all known polit philosophi there mai be just an advantag in have an eisenhow type who sai he doesnt have ani polit philosophi or at least not yet dan let me ask you about the latest figur on the economi that came out which continu to show that despit econom growth there is increas poverti in thi countri of cours presid clinton allud to that problem yesterdai and the <unk> of those two figur well you know it the great paradox of america employ goe up and poverti goe up to thirti nine point three million american and by the wai poverti how it defin to be poor you have to have under fifteen thousand dollar a year for a famili of four so poor is realli poor well presid clinton sai you know theyr more low pai job not enough high paid job not enough educ train for better paid skill he sai it a twenti year trend aggrav dure the reagan and bush year but now a budget wari administr and a do noth congress and what the trend is there and not much is happen to revers that trend the new from iraq thi morn is that whatev advanc of tank column mai or mai not have been occur toward the border with kuwait ha appar stop but what do you make of the fact that just as the u n is contempl lift sanction there appar ha been thi movement toward the border of a coupl of iraqi tank divis well mayb it a kind of bluff to try to forc them to lift the sanction we dont know yet some famou last word when it come to saddam hussein is he wouldnt dare attack right so mayb it a bluff it mayb not and id be the last on to try to predict mayb he think onc again as he onc told ambassador april <unk> that american prize their live too highli to risk them in a war he learn that wasnt true then is he will to try it again doe he look at somalia and bosnia and the congression pressur to get out of haiti and sai o k now mayb i can try is he readi for anoth miscalcul well soon know event in haiti thi week the newli restor haitian parliament ha approv an amnesti plan but on that

45,925,senat diann feinstein discuss the tumultu california elect what a democrat to do now that the on hundr third congress is histori and the republican control on hundr fourth promis to be anyth but busi as usual well work in a bipartisan wai to pass a balanc budget amend to enact the line item veto to allow peopl to vote for constitut amend for term limit to enact campaign spend reform which is even more import todai than it wa yesterdai what thi democrat to do when she claim victori and her oppon in california caustic and costli senat race claim fraud it so overwhelm i would hope we would have a new elect if it not if it not i will congratul ms feinstein on her victori but i think frankli the fraud is overwhelm is senat feinstein star still bright though the democrat parti whole constel ha dim from washington thi is newsmak saturdai with charl bierbauer thank for join us with congresss lame duck pack up and limp home we mai all be reliev that thi <unk> session is over but it alwai open season for polit in washington and to help us take aim on the new congress our guest is senat diann feinstein of california the senat wa elect to a short term in congress in nineteen nineti two and with nearli forti seven percent of last month vote is the presumpt though not yet certifi winner of a full term in the senat thank you for join us senat and with me to question senat feinstein is gloria borger assist manag editor and polit columnist for u s new and world report senat is thi elect and your <unk> of thi seat in ani wai tarnish by the kind of race that wa run in california by the kind of charg were hear of fraud well see thi wa the worst race iv been in in my life sinc februari blatant mislead mischaracter i think <unk> spot were run in a barrag that wa unpreced in the histori of thi countri never ha anyon spent the kind of monei my oppon did or engag in the kind of campaign my oppon did so the fact that i endur and endur by on hundr sixti thousand vote which incident is histor not a close elect you have to rememb <unk> beat ed <unk> by less than on hundr fifti thousand vote well there ar a lot of voter in california that right and <unk> beat bradlei by under on hundr thousand vote so i look at thi with a great deal of surpris that my oppon didnt pick up the phone and sai you know congratul youv won as i have done when i have lost race the reason your oppon congressman huffington sai he wont do that is he is continu to alleg that there were improprieti that there were <unk> <unk> in thi elect campaign so what your describ as bitter and nasti wa the elect race but the post elect race continu to be accusatori let me plai a piec of tape and get you to respond here thi is repres huffington the other night the problem is there a lot of voter fraud and were find out daili that new thing ar come in with peopl who either arent legal citizen who ar vote theyv move and ar vote in the wrong place we have board up shack where peopl sai thei live we have peopl vote in vacant park lot is thi what happen where the evid he got a temporari restrain order on the basi of that comment there wa a hear befor a judg in lo angel the judg said where is your evid and thei didnt submit ani evid so now theyr go out and theyr look for more but i didnt win by on hundr vote or eight hundr vote or ten thousand on hundr sixti thousand vote how is that issu that he promot now that there wa fraud or shack how is that go to chang the outcom of the elect becaus unless he can sai there were on hundr sixti thousand peopl who vote for me fraudul i have legal won thi elect and i believ i will be certifi by the state of california and the secretari of state as the winner of the elect do you have ani evid that why thi is so unbeliev to have thi happen but thi seem like more than sour grape do you have ani evid of fraud i have no evid of fraud and the proper place to submit evid for fraud is to the secretari of state to the attornei gener to a district attornei of a counti there mai be some investig go on but if there ar on or two or two hundr or three hundr instanc of someon who should not have vote who vote doe that undo a plural of on hundr sixti thousand vote that the issu is thi someth mr huffington cant let go of how do you judg thi well i think mr huffington is us to get what he want and he want thi and he spent more than anybodi ever ha in the histori of thi countri to bui it and he couldnt bui it and now he go to find anoth wai of win it that what happen senat you said befor that you were the victim of some t v ad that were untru now you have an opportun to do someth about televis ad in campaign financ reform tell us what you would do for senat in your posit in anoth campaign and how can you chang thi whole process well i think that campaign spend reform ha to go back on the front burner in a major wai and i think the deal breaker in campaign spend reform wa what peopl perceiv to be when you limit the amount under bucklei versu <unk> you also had to then provid some public financ and the public financ wa done through lobbi disclosur fee and other thing but peopl didnt see that and it wa us as an argument against i dont think we should do ani public financ i think we should find a wai and i believ we can to cap the race to cap the amount an individu can put into a race and to provid an amend to the feder commun act which would enabl a televis station if thei were convinc that an ad wa fals and defamatori not to run it what we found in thi campaign is even when a station would tell us ye thei saw where the ad wa fals thei still had to run it do you have support for that in the senat i think we have increas support for it and the reason i sai thi is becaus there never ha been a campaign where there ar more neg and nasti spot out there than thi past on and i think that ha caus peopl to think and particularli the california race ha caus peopl to think becaus what the california race signal is anybodi that will to come forward and put up thirti million dollar doesnt have to debat their oppon doesnt have to do press interview doesnt have to give out a vote record doesnt have to reduc tax reform thei just do their number in thirti second sound bite and that not what elect to the highest <unk> bodi in the land should be let me pick up when you sai you would cap the spend where would you cap it in a state like california what would be an approxim amount and it would seem that you could cap the spend but how do you get rid of the neg you would have fewer of them with less spend well the spend in the last bill that we consid and wa pass through the senat california wa the highest state becaus it the biggest cap at eight point eight million dollar and then it went down from there base on popul of the state and i think to base a cap on popul make veri good sens and it also provid that individu in veri small state can cover their state when you run in a state that bigger than most nation it a veri real problem to go door to door or even sometim counti to counti but senat now the democrat dont control the senat anymor why would thei go along with campaign financ reform and try and level the plai field thei want to get a major back well thi mai sound naiv but it the right thing to do and the track that campaign ar on is not go to be good for either parti becaus i believ veri much that we can work <unk> i believ there ar veri good peopl in both polit parti and i believ we ar elect im a democrat im elect to bring my viewpoint to sit down with colleagu and work out a solut just as we did on the assault weapon legisl on the desert bill just as well do on a balanc budget amend or on anyth els that come up but to work out the differ and on of the thing that happen is it been a veri distast kind of partisanship and fortun there ar peopl in both parti that ar prepar to resist it and i wa veri <unk> by what senat lott said todai that he look forward to work in a bipartisan wai he and i have work on a bill that we didnt have a lot of luck with but we work togeth on and that wa to put off the next round of base closur senat lott is of cours the newli elect major whip in the senat a republican youv touch on a number of agenda issu balanc budget amend line item veto and that exactli where want to go when we come back weve got to take a break stai with us pleas commerci break senat feinstein you list thing that you want to do in a bipartisan fashion balanc budget amend line item veto term limit that sound like someth newt gingrich ha written that sound like the republican contract ar you realli close in line with that well i campaign on it in nineteen nineti two when i ran i vote for it and i campaign again it all depend on how you word a balanc budget amend and i think it possibl to word on thatll make some sens and the degre to which it make sens obvious it take time to accomplish it it also take time for ratif so the time that built into it and exactli what is cover by it ar realli the issu for negoti on the line item veto there isnt a chief execut offic of ani corpor in thi countri that doesnt have the abil to control the budget of their compani and yet the presid of the unit state doesnt have the abil to control the budget i think it doe two thing i think it will ensur a disciplin i think it will give a blue pencil that mean someth to the chief execut and i think it is the biggest antidot to the pork barrel i know well ar you concern just to follow thi ar you concern that the white hous and the democrat ar <unk> the agenda to the republican no not necessarili and im not the onli democrat that feel thi wai i think on of the mistak peopl have made is to sai that there ar specif <unk> territori and the parti do not cross on them i think there ar some ye but i do not think these ar necessarili them paul simon as you know wa on of the co author of the last balanc budget amend so it ha been a bipartisan effort let me just shift gear a littl bit to talk about proposit on eighti seven which wa a major issu in your campaign and it a measur that would deni medic and educ benefit to illeg alien in your state you were oppos to it and the voter overwhelmingli approv it in california who wa right well i knew when i did that that it could possibl cost me the elect we estim it cost six to ten point have said that i couldnt have live with myself becaus essenti what on eighti seven doe is sai that children ar go to be the enforc mechan for illeg immigr and the wai that go to happen is thei ar go to be prohibit an educ and i think that a terribl mistak and i dont believ it stop illeg immigr i believ what we must do and i look forward to work again in a bipartisan wai particularli with alan simpson who head the subcommitte on immigr of the judiciari committe we can stop it at it border iv been to the border mani time there a new oper go on on the southwest border and it about eighti percent effect now we need to do some other thing we need to have a counterfeit proof system of determin work elig and that could also <unk> with welfar elig we need to stop immigr at the border which mean have a full complement of border patrol give them the equip thei need we need to stop illeg smuggl i wa shock when the u s attornei in san diego told me that the averag feder sentenc for somebodi convict of alien smuggl with a prior wa zero to six month but senat well chang that but you seem to be talk about more govern involv here beef up border patrol et cetera it cost a lot of monei on the other hand your talk about a constitut amend to balanc the budget where do you get the monei for thi then well in my legisl i put in a fund mechan and what it is is a border cross fee of on dollar which would produc at a minimum four hundr million dollar it would be much as somebodi that cross a bridg weve got in my citi the golden gate bridg the oakland bai bridg and peopl pai three dollar a dai when thei come in to work in san francisco on the golden gate bridg you would just simpli pai you could have commut book but you would pai for the infrastructur that you us and that would support the infrastructur and the border patrol and custom and narcot abat and activ to prevent illeg smuggl that a tax isnt it it a cross fee which is paid for by the peopl that us the border is that popular it not paid by peopl who dont us the border outsid of california and perhap texa it veri popular in california poll have shown it get over eighti percent support from the peopl speak of tax where ar you on the middl class tax cut see i think that wa the on perhap major crippl <unk> thing in the presid program the campaign commit to a middl incom tax cut now some of thi wa provid with the earn incom tax credit which provid that if you earn up to twenti five thousand dollar a year you get a tax credit but from twenti five thousand dollar on up to seventi five thousand dollar that where famili ar the hardest hit and on of the most prevail feel out there is you know i work hard i plai by the rule i pai my tax and im worri about my job i take home less and the frustrat is all thi govern im pai for all the gui that dont plai by the rule and that why i think give relief to the middl class is so import and im realli sorri that that got by but now that there is deficit reduct now that the feder workforc is

and the presid presid clinton is thi week now talk about work out some kind of a middl class tax cut but it come back to the question i ask you befor hasnt he been push to all thi by the republican rather than move on hi own agenda to get there and look mai i sai thi sure you couldnt have done it without do someth about the budget deficit becaus he did that that wa taken care of but he did that and then pretti much abandon that middl class tax cut well that right becaus the economi wa bad and revenu werent come in and we had to go through with the deficit reduct packag if you rememb charl

46,945,im jim moret in lo angel talk back live is not be seen so that we can bring you continu coverag of the o j simpson case a hear is underwai right now deputi district attornei hank goldberg is address the court respond to a defens motion to remov prosecutor christoph darden from the prosecut team let listen in refus to do so what the prosecut did in that case is thei said to the cousin we wont make you testifi if you get on of the brother to plead guilti to me that seem like outrag prosecutori misconduct and it seem like it should warrant some extraordinari sanction becaus it doe seem to be a veri flagrant misus of the grand juri process the sanction that wa sought in that case wa <unk> the subpoena and what the court held in that case and it wa quit extraordinari wa that it wa improp to quash the subpoena becaus thei said that even though there wa an improp purpos behind <unk> the cousin there wa also a proper purpos becaus he did have some relev evid and therefor the court should not have quash the subpoena thei also went on at length to describ the rule that onc it is shown that the subpoena might aid the grand juri in it investig becaus that it cannot be quash simpli becaus there is also a possibl the prosecutor will us it for some purpos other than obtain evid for the grand juri and thei also went at length describ that as long as the grand juri constitut a good faith inquiri as to possibl crimin charg that ani evid that is discov incident to that grand juri can be us in ani subsequ crimin proceed so i realli dont see what it is about thi case that the defens feel actual support their rule of a wall of separ or support their argument for the extraordinari sanction thei ar seek in fact it a veri strong case in favor of the prosecut next thei cite <unk> versu oregon that wa on page five of their brief that just a case that deal with the constitution of notic of alibi rule it ha noth to do with grand juri at all so i wont discuss it further and the california case thei cite wa in re <unk> that wa at page six and that simpli sai that the grand juri wa direct the district attornei to issu a subpoena that the district attornei cant issu hi own subpoena when he conduct a grand juri investig it ha to do with statutori construct and is not at all pertin to the issu befor thi court but what these case do show is that even the most egregi violat and misus of the grand juri in the feder system to not result in ani sanction at all let alon the extraordinari sanction the defens is seek here id next like to turn to a discuss of nine hundr twenti four point six which wa the final author that counsel cite but i found hi comment about make a motion or want to make motion to have the inform releas extraordinari becaus i think he is acknowledg as we do that he is go to be entitl to the grand juri transcript that it would constitut inform that would be relev in thi trial and onc he get them what on earth is the basi for hi argument that there need to be thi continu rule a separ when he is in possess of the exact same materi that we ar in possess of well it not exactli the same i mean to be in a grand juri proceed eyebal to eyebal with wit and to be in the posit to conduct the examin is differ than read a transcript of what somebodi els did yeah that true your honor and in fact we cite a california case in our point and author that talk about a situat where a district attornei had particip in a sting type oper and then after he had particip in that he want to prosecut the case and there wa some argument well mayb he in a better posit or he in a more advantag posit as a result of actual have wit the oper and that that differ from read polic report and the like yet the california court said that that wa not a basi for <unk> so i think the precis concern that your honor just rais ha been address in a california case that is directli analog and also id point out your honor that in ani case where we have a grand juri and there is an indict and the transcript ar then turn over to the defens we still have had the advantag of have been there wherea the defens wa not so that we could observ the demeanor of wit and no on ha ever suggest that that present a reason for <unk> or ani kind of problem at all befor get into my discuss on nine hundr twenti four let me just sure forgiv me for interrupt you befor you move on from that point let me just clarifi so it clear in my mind you ar conced on behalf of the prosecut that the defens in thi case is entitl to discoveri of the transcript of the cowl grand juri proceed ye your honor when i sai the transcript of the cowl grand juri proceed im not refer to the in camera motion or ani in camera proceed that onli involv mr darden simpli becaus those would involv attornei work product in other word if he had ani in camera proceed where he wa justifi the reason for call wit and the like and hi theori as to the relev of the wit and why thei shed some light that would clearli constitut attornei work product but as to the grand juri proceed itself ye we do make that concess id also like to point out just anoth misstat that i do not believ ron philip phil vannatt or tom lang testifi befor the cowl grand juri i think that wa a slight misstat on the defend part although im not sure that it necessarili all that signific but the point is onc thei have everyth that we have i dont see the basi for thi motion at all so what thei ar seek seem to be a classic instanc of put the cart befor the hors in other word if im understand their posit and mayb counsel will clarifi it for us when he address you again is well we dont know for sure that were go to get everyth although the prosecut seem to be conced thi so mayb we wont get everyth and to the extent that there some stuff that mayb the prosecut will have that we dont have that unfair but thi is a classic instanc of an issu that is not right for decis becaus wouldnt the defens have to go and make that motion wouldnt the court then have to in our view violat the clear mandat of nine hundr twenti four point six which sai that we shall give them relev inform wouldnt we have to violat that mandat and hold certain thing back and then wouldnt it be right for the defens to come befor your honor and sai look we didnt get everyth we need some remedi as a result of thi but now what thei want to do is ask for the remedi befor it proper to do so befor theyv even made an attempt to seek the evid so id submit that it clearli isnt right for the court to decid what if ani remedi should be appli for a fact pattern that hasnt occur yet id also point out that in addit to have access to the grand juri transcript which we believ the defens is entitl to thei also had access to the wit thei were abl to interview the wit in fact an order wa made to that effect at the time of the grand juri i simpli dont see how nine hundr twenti four point six support their posit in fact it seem to veri strongli support the prosecut posit that thei ar entitl to inform that is relev and is <unk> from the grand juri now the final content that thei made and i think thi seem to tie into nine hundr twenti four point six is that somehow the if im understand it correctli the us of the grand juri by the prosecut violat california discoveri law as codifi by proposit on hundr fifteen in california penal code section on thousand fifti four what id like to point out about on thousand fifti four if i have the direct quot here is that on thousand fifti four sai that discoveri shall not occur in crimin case accept as provid by thi chapter and other express statutori provis so on thousand fifti four didnt do anyth to elimin other discoveri vehicl to the extent that thei exist under other statutori provis found elsewher in the california penal code or evid code i dont think that it necessarili proper to character im not suggest that it proper to character a grand juri as a discoveri vehicl i dont think that is an appropri character but the point is that on thousand fifti four didnt do anyth to chang alter or effect the exist statutori scheme with respect to grand juri also what counsel is entitl to under nine hundr twenti four point six is all relev evid from the grand juri and id go on step further which is to suggest that even if evid wasnt relev and admiss which is the languag of the statut that if there were somehow if we could somehow imagin a scenario where there wa inadmiss evid that nevertheless point to <unk> evid that the defens would probabl be entitl to that too constitution speak and if the statut should be so constru becaus it should be constru in a manner that consist with the unit state constitut so thei get relev and admiss evid and then theyr go to get anyth that point to ani <unk> evid which should cover absolut everyth but the point is your honor is that what thei ar go to get under nine hundr twenti four point six is ident to what theyr entitl to under penal code section on thousand fifti four in other word what thei get under on thousand fifti four is thei get all relev and admiss evid which is evid that the prosecut reason anticip introduc such as the name and address of wit real and physic evid expert list for the past half an hour youv been listen to deputi district attornei hank goldberg present hi argument defend their us of christoph darden on the prosecut team while presid clinton wa speak in miami the defens present it argument on why it believ christoph darden should be <unk> or remov from the prosecut team you mai recal that christoph darden led the govern case and investig against al cowl no charg were ever file let listen now to an extend excerpt of defens attornei gerald uelmen almost two month after hi arrest in august of nineteen nineti four the lo angel counti grand juri began hear evid includ the testimoni of mani of the wit who had testifi at the preliminari hear other wit who were anticip to be trial wit some employe of mr simpson and lawyer and expert assist in hi defens pursuant to that grand juri investig a subpoena wa serv on mr shapiro demand the product of mr simpson person calendar for the year lead up to june seventeenth mr shapiro did not have the calendar in hi possess but he made arrang for that to be turn over to the grand juri and then on august twelfth in <unk> of thi grand juri investig a search warrant wa serv at mr simpson offic at on thousand on hundr sixti on san <unk> boulevard and a number of document and telephon record were seiz pursuant to that search warrant now of cours a grand juri investig is conduct in secreci the defens ha no opportun to particip in the grand juri proceed so the conduct of a grand juri investig while we were in the midst of trial prepar rais a number of seriou concern for the defens with respect to the potenti improp us of a grand juri as a discoveri tool in order to assist the prosecut to prepar for trial so we respond with two motion first a motion wa file seek remedi for prosecutori abus of the grand juri function and that motion wa heard by judg steven <unk> of thi court on august twenti sixth at the same time we amend the pend motion to suppress evid that wa befor thi court to includ the evid seiz from mr simpson offic on august twelfth and the prosecutori respons to both of those motion wa essenti the same their respons wa that a wall had been erect to separ the grand juri investig from the proceed of thi trial when we went befor judg <unk> judg <unk> wa given a declar sign by deputi district attornei christoph darden which told him that the onli purpos of the grand juri investig wa to determin if there wa potenti crimin respons of al cowl or other in aid or abet a flight by mr simpson involv in the bronco chase of june seventeenth and assur were given that the investig wa be kept separ from thi trial that the prosecutor for the trial team of marcia clark and bill hodgman were not direct mr darden activ or receiv the inform acquir in the cours of hi investig and base on those assur judg <unk> conclud that sanction were not warrant but he did order that the grand juri wit should be advis that thei could discuss their testimoni if thei chose with repres of the defens and he also order that if ani wit on the defens wit list for thi trial were summon befor the grand juri to testifi that the prosecutor should report that to judg <unk> and he should be advis of the natur of the inquiri so that he could continu to exercis the import judici function of supervis the independ and integr of the grand juri investig now with respect to the motion to suppress in respons to the motion to suppress your honor wa told by the prosecut that thei did not intend to us ani of the evid that wa seiz from mr simpson offic in thi trial so there wa no need to <unk> the legal of that search and thi court wa also told that the two matter were be kept to us the precis word of marcia clark as separ as possibl and that if ani evid from the cowl inquiri ever becom german to thi case your honor wa told by ms clark that the prosecut will seek further guidanc from thi court and as far as we know no such guidanc ha ever been sought on octob eighteenth mr darden conclud the grand juri investig advis the grand juri that their servic would no longer be requir and on novemb seventh when district attornei gil garcetti made three veri signific announc with respect to thi motion number on he announc that there wa insuffici evid to prosecut mr cowl for the charg be investig by the grand juri and that the grand juri investig wa conclud number two he announc that deputi district attornei christoph darden wa be assign to the trial team for the o j simpson trial and that he would plai a veri activ role in court as on of the senior prosecutor in the case and number three mr garcetti announc that he did not regard the assign of mr darden to thi case to be inconsist wit the wall of separ that exist between the grand juri investig and thi trial he said the wall is there believ me that wall is <unk> there is no conflict now thi motion to recus mr darden from the case wa then file and i want to emphas that it is not a challeng to hi integr or to hi compet it simpli assert that a wall of separ is still necessari between that grand juri investig and thi trial and even though the grand juri ha conclud it investig and thi wall cannot be maintain and the court cannot perform the function it ha mandat to perform under california law if mr darden is function as an activ member of the prosecut team in thi trial and what i want to do is address the import interest that ar still at stake to suggest the continu need for a wall of separ the suggest that the wall can come down becaus the grand juri investig is complet suggest somehow that the wall exist to protect the grand juri and that is simpli not the case the purpos of a wall of separ is to protect the right of mr simpson in thi trial and the need to do that continu throughout the trial let bring in our c n n legal analyst greta van susteren a trial attornei who join us from our washington studio greta the defens claim that there should be a wall erect between the cowl grand juri investig and the simpson case what your assess well jim first of all california doesnt requir that what the defens claim is that the prosecut ha unfair inform becaus thei conduct anoth investig a grand juri investig the state of california sai fine you can have the transcript from that proceed so that it is inde a level plai field you have the inform that we <unk> the defens then come back and sai well we mai have the same inform but the grand juri in the cowl investig ha been <unk> in other word thei have us that grand juri to investig the o j simpson case by <unk> befor that grand juri wit the defens intend to us dure the cours of the trial which might not otherwis even talk to the prosecut so theyr also argu abus now the prosecut claim that there no appear of improprieti in us chri darden on the grand juri investig and then in the simpson case what your opinion well thei mai claim there no appear of improprieti and that mai protect them but you have to check the wisdom of the decis to put christoph darden on thi case the last thing that a prosecutor should do is inject an appel issu into the case whether thei win or lose todai if christoph darden remain on that case and if o j simpson is inde convict that will be an issu in the court of appeal and there mai be a revers in the court of appeal on that issu if the defens should win the problem is no prosecutor want that and mr garcetti ha nine hundr other d as to select from so you must look at the wisdom of put mr darden on thi case you dont want to creat an appel issu thank greta we will take a short break now and be back with more of c n n coverag of the o j simpson case right after thi,
47,962,im judi woodruff in washington we interrupt our live coverag of the o j simpson hear in lo angel with some break new on the bosnian situat on the telephon with me now live is doctor radovan karadz the leader of the bosnian serb doctor karadz can you hear me at thi moment ye i can tell me about these develop we understand that you have been talk with former u s presid jimmi carter can you tell us about your convers with him ye i had a pleasant opportun and a great honor to talk on the telephon to presid jimmi carter our organ ha act in a complet accord on some point and first of them is that serb side shall immedi normal relat with unprofor and there ar other point if your interest i can tell you ye wed like to know what thei ar i understand thei have to do both with releas u n personnel who have been detain and with releas some bosnian muslim soldier ye exactli we agre that we should free all u n personnel and complet recov our own relat to the unprofor and establish statu quo befor thi crisi then to releas younger war prison of muslim side then we said that we will immedi ceas fire in the area of sarajevo and then open sarajevo airport for humanitarian and unprofor flight the airport ha been close for last coupl of week becaus of the crisi with nato and final we of cours have been talk on the human right and we certainli confirm that we ar go to respect human right in our futur arrang in our entiti in former bosnia hercegovina just to clarifi unprofor be the u n peacekeep oper the peacekeep troop who ar there in bosnia why have you agre to do thi what do you expect to come out of thi well we have been look forward to have thi relat re establish but there have been mani mani tension becaus of nato bomb our territori and that wa veri good opportun to talk to presid carter and to discuss the situat and to confirm that now we ar just about at a time to do some breakthrough and i do hope that well have presid carter here visit serb and muslim side veri soon so for the occas of that possibl i fulli agre with presid carter to do mani thing to improv situat you sai you hope that presid carter will visit there in bosnia perhap in pale ha he agre to come ha presid clinton sign off on a visit by presid by former presid carter well i think presid carter said that he is go immedi to inform presid clinton about serbian accept serbian readi to improv the situat and i do not have ani doubt thei will consult and i do hope after thi consult that presid carter mai come here and mai help us to find a wai out of thi crisi as he us to do in somalia and north korea and elsewher but at thi moment it is not confirm yet that mr carter go is that right well i think we can keep almost for sure that he is go to come and do you know when i think within next few dai he would come to sarajevo and to pale to see both war faction and to facilit possibl talk on the soon polit settlement of the crisi doctor karadz im sure it wouldnt surpris you to know that some peopl in look at these step that your govern is will to take would sai these ar thing that you have offer to do befor and that thi doe not get at the heart of much of the problem in bosnia which would eventu have to includ the relinquish the agreement to relinquish some of the territori your troop have taken well we ar propos an immedi end of the war but we know that the intern commun and the muslim side is fear we ar go to keep the whole territori that we now control we ar readi to oblig that we ar not go to keep the whole territori and we ar go we ar readi to negoti territori issu and establish immedi peac we ar agre to come back to the talk if we ar equal treat as the muslim and croatian side let me go over with you doctor karadz while i have you these as i take note six point on is that there would be free movement permit of all u n convoi in bosnia second that there would be a releas of all u n personnel who ar be detain or restrain third ye is that correct yeah but the second is first and first is second it all the same all right all the same and then next ani bosnian muslim soldier who ar under twenti year old would be releas no nineteen nineteen under the ag of nineteen ye and fourth there would be an immedi ceas fire in sarajevo and in the surround area ye and reopen all the sarajevo airport and sixth or rather fifth the reopen of the sarajevo airport and to remain open for how long a period of time for humanitarian and for unprofor flight and i do think it is go to be to stai open unlimit unless we get anoth strike or anoth terribl crisi and final we just saw there to guarante human right and what is your definit of that sir well we ar readi to accept all of the intern norm and convent on human right and thi is civil war and thi is veri difficult to achiev immedi and for everyon but we ar commit to that to do it now and in futur and sinc we do hope that we ar approach polit settlement we would accept all of the intern commun convent on human right doctor karadz why do you believ it necessari to bring former presid carter into thi there have been so mani effort to resolv the crisi in your countri why now bring former presid carter in well as a matter of fact all group and individu that tri to mediat didnt treat serbian side equal and thi is the best wai not to resolv conflict just to <unk> onli on side and i do think that presid carter as a repres of america and possibl of presid clinton made a great deal in somalia and north korea and we too think that that would be someth differ if he come here and help and try to help us well for exampl what do you expect to get in a negoti that jimmi carter would be involv in that you have not receiv in the other effort by either where therev been unit state repres lord owen and so mani other whove tri to help get thi situat resolv our request ar veri simpl we want to be treat absolut equal as the intern commun treat the muslim croatian feder thi feder ha been form in washington so we want to have the same right as the muslim croatian feder and we want to have the right for self determin and sovereignti as muslim croatian feder ha sovereignti and we want the right to confeder with neighbor state as muslim croatian feder ha the right to confeder with croatia simpli we do not ask for anyth except for what the other side alreadi ha what about territori doctor karadz how much territori that your side ha captur ar you prepar to relinquish to give up well we own in term of privat ownership sixti four percent but we do not claim for all sixti four percent we control about seventi percent for the defens and strateg reason i would rather not talk on a percentag becaus it mean noth i would rather talk on viabil of state sinc we ar go to have two state within former bosnia hercegovina let us talk about two viabl state we ar readi to help muslim croatian feder to be viabl state and we do expect the other to accept our state to be viabl and ar you sai let me just make sure i understand thi ar you sai your prepar to talk about the creation of a bosnian muslim entiti that would be viabl that would have the sort of connect to the outsid world to neighbor countri that that state would need as well ye absolut otherwis we would not have a long last peac here so we ar go to take all the interest of our neighbor and we ar go to cooper if we make a good long last solut we would be stabl area otherwis we would have long ongo war doctor karadz did you attempt to do thi to contact the clinton administr directli to talk to them about ani of thi or with ani of your european neighbor or did you why again im try to get at why jimmi carter well we have been talk to mani diplomat throughout the world unfortun so far it seem to us that america ha been a littl bit bias in favor of the muslim what i would like america is to not to take a side and to be absolut imparti in order to help us to get out of thi crisi otherwis we would not get ani solut and i do think that presid carter in the capac of possibl american repres or presid clinton repres will be and would be imparti ar you ar you absolut persuad that if presid carter were to come he would be speak for the u s govern well i do hope that it would be in an accord with presid clinton or at least presid carter would inform presid clinton what serb ar readi to accept and did you discuss thi with former presid carter with that particular aspect of it ye i would discuss with presid carter everi possibl affect and possibl to get out of thi crisi i would present the serbian minimum requir and need and demand and i would present what we can swallow what we can accept so we know that thi solut is go to be unjust but let make it unjust equal and just to both side let make it equal pain to both side not onli pain for the serbian side let me just ask you final im go to wrap up here doctor karadz why should the rest of the world take you serious that you mean busi now when the impress so mani have had up until now is that you have not follow through on your commit well i would not agre with that sinc we should be trust that we ar not interest in a war sinc we ar readi to give back some territori why we would last thi war longer and we havent been listen to carefulli we ar claim for an immedi peac and for a fair settlement but we havent been listen to carefulli and we have been onli side under the pressur while the muslim side have been encourag to go on with the fight all right and just quickli final doctor karadz again on these six point these ar thing that you ar sai your side is prepar to do as long as negoti talk ar under wai is that correct ye that correct all right all right it is go to start tomorrow and thi would all begin tomorrow includ the ceas fire in sarajevo the releas of the u n troop the releas of some of the young muslim soldier and so forth ye all of that would be achiev within next twenti four hour all right well doctor radovan karadz the leader of the bosnian serb on the telephon with us from pale in bosnia we thank you for be with us,
