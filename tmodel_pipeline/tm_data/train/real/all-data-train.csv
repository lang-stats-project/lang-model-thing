quickli becam a member of the famili we had been wait wait for him to come and the children were anticip and so thei were real excit about it he came right in just like hed alwai live here and that amaz me in some wai it wa a lot easier than we all expect home video captur gregori twelfth birthdai celebr with hi new famili hi first vacat and an affection moment with hi foster father what do you call your foster parent i call my foster parent mom and dad and you feel thei ar mm hmm the question now wa could gregori be offici adopt at that point in time i figur that get gregori elig for adopt would not be a difficult thing becaus of the lack of interest that had been shown by hi parent for reunif tom man is execut director of the boi ranch where young boi like gregori wait for the state to make a decis on whether theyll be return to their parent or put up for adopt by law children ar not suppos to remain in foster care for more than a year after eighteen month the state is requir to termin parent right or return the child to hi parent but that legal limit is rare enforc when gregori first met hi new foster famili he had been in foster care for almost two year hi mother had not call or written to him in the entir time he had been at the boi ranch we were told that she hadnt done anyth and she probabl wouldnt and we would probabl be abl to adopt him rachel how did you first learn that gregori want to be adopt actual my h r s worker said the foster parent want to meet with me and so i decid to meet with them and i want to tell them thank you for take good care of my son and found out that thei want to adopt him what wa your reaction how did you feel i couldnt believ it at first becaus i thought that when i saw gregori and wa abl to show him that we had a good home that he would want to come home but gregori had decid hi mother had had her last chanc he had found a place to be and wa determin to be adopt it wa liz who got the call from h r s tell her gregori file wa no longer be process for adopt hi mother rachel want him back i think my wife origin got the call and she call me at work and she said well what should i do should i tell him thei want to send him back to hi biolog famili against hi wish i did what i think wa the proper thing to do i said bring him to my offic i sat him down and i told him first of all what had transpir that hi parent want him to come back he immedi and veri adamantli said i will not go back i wont go back so i ask my foster father what i could do to stai with him and he told me i could call a lawyer and then i ask him like if he ha anybodi he know that is a good lawyer and he told me my lawyer jerri blair and he told me her phone number and i call her jerri blair is a florida attornei who ha earn a reput defend children right after hear gregori stori she agre to take hi case for free from the moment that he walk into my offic i could tell that he wa a veri determin child my reaction wa on of want to help him immedi of believ him it a case that ha to do with allow littl children to come to the court in order to protect themselv when all els fail to help them to save them from fall through the crack in a system that is full of crack becaus the system is fail all over thi countri you seem to know veri much what you want all the kid know what thei want thei just dont speak up about it your attornei said that you might have a better chanc if your case wa file by an adult and you said no you want it to be in your name why becaus i knew if i put it in my name it would make it differ it wouldnt be some adult do it itd be a child do it and it would make it differ and it might be abl to help other children it like if we win thi case then thei wont be abl to put children in foster care so long as thei do and if thei do thei can come to court when we come back the stun conclus of gregori stori a new and disturb twist that could have a big impact on the upcom court battl stai with us the onli thing

ten ye a scale from on to ten ten realli absolut absolut presid bush in everi encount i ever had with him as the command in chief that what im talk about from the dai i walk in from the nation secur council meet to camp david to hi encount come over dure the war absolut wa everyth that ani theater command could have ever ask for in a command in chief on a scale of on to ten colin powel ten on a scale of on to ten defens secretari richard chenei nine and a three quarter ah okai no he wa we were a team we were a team and you have to rememb that when your make moment decis you have that mani involv a great respons with great ego you know obvious there go to be debat that goe on and that sort of thing but the amaz part about it wa that on everi decis when it final came about we were all in complet agreement well let me pick up some thing that you do sai okai you write that secretari chenei wa on of the <unk> cold warrior in congress you word not mine and that there were time dure the war when he want to out gener the gener no i said in the book what i realli said wa i wa concern at on point that he mai have he mai start be like some of the former secretari of the armi i have seen who tri to out gener the gener well he had hi own offens plan that you didnt agre with yeah and that wa but that wa the onli time and iv got to tell you that that why i said nine and three quarter but for the most part he stai veri much veri strictli in the polici we had on the ev of the ground war you write that all the presid advis were for you the onli agenc to dissent wa the c i a that the c i a wa still sai that the the damag by the iraqi wa not as great as you said and you write if we had want to convinc the c i a we would still be sit in saudi <unk> what do you think of the c i a i hope you recogn the tongu in cheek natur of that comment no i didnt you know my discuss of the c i a wa onli in the veri veri small world that i wa look in not in the entir but in your small world thei werent too effect thei did not help me as a as a theater command as much i felt thei could have what you did feel on of your problem in the dai befor the war wa that you got differ direct from washington almost everi dai you write decis in washington would be motiv more by polit than by militari realiti i worri about that okai i knew that washington had it own hand full with get the support from the congress and that sort of thing but my job wa to look at matter pure as the militari command in the field and that wa somebodi els job to worri about that other stuff but you talk about the hawk especi the hawk in the nation secur council you sai thei had a john wayn mental thei had seen too much of rambo the hawk i said i worri about that but more than worri about it at that particular time you said you write about on white hous hawk and he caus you a big problem but you dont name him your write histori you know why i dont name him number becaus im not too sure of thi think it wa brent <unk> i dont know i have no idea but it wa the hawk yeah becaus that wa the term that wa be us but you dont know which gui it wa by the peopl in washington that were talk to me i mean thei refer to the hawk back here and there ar some peopl back here who want to do thi and if you if you get to the point where you think your be forc to do someth militarili that go to kill a whole bunch of peopl and you dont believ in it then you have an option the option is you can be remov from your job and somebodi els can be put in there and i wa quit prepar for that and the bottom line is that all these other peopl realli didnt matter the peopl that matter wa the presid of the unit state secretari chenei and colin powel and thei werent push you number but the onli time i ever felt push wa realli that that on time when you know we were within dai of launch the war and the weather peopl came in and said the weather is go to be lousi and my marin command and some of my armi command were sai we cant go if the weather is lousi and i felt oblig to report that to washington obvious it caus them some concern what happen wa that you end up have a shout match with colin powel who said well well that your word your word it wa dont dont it right there in the book and now your sit with me no i i want to make sure it present in the proper context okai you know i felt veri strongli about what i wa sai and colin wa under and i wa under tremend pressur and colin wa under tremend pressur too what he said wa how am i go to go back to my presid who readi to attack now on februari twenti fourth that he ha to wait two dai and what about all the public pressur you know what about public opinion sure so you had a big showdown yeah and i said hei but i have my command over here tell me that thei cant attack okai unless thei have thi air cover becaus the weather is so bad and thei wont do it and and but it wa a flash in the pan caus both of us understood that what the other on wa sai wa right okai suppos the weather had been bad and colin powel or washington said you have got to go on the twenti fourth which might have happen the weather clear up and you were okai you went on the twenti fourth and you knew that you would lose the live of men would you have follow those order and attack on the twenti fourth i would have said i want to talk to the presid and if he had said go i dont know that too hypothet becaus i cant you know but i would have i would have i would have insist at that point i would have felt it wa my respons to present directli to the presid of the unit state what my concern were not my concern but the concern of my command whose live of the troop were in their hand what wa the influenc of televis in washington and on you well the influenc of televis wa veri good in mani wai and it wa also disrupt in mani wai i turn off the televis set in my headquart and kept them off most of the time becaus a great deal of the inform that wa come across the televis set wa veri inaccur and someplac along the line it might effect critic decis so i just we didnt have them turn on the american peopl right to know right versu you as a gener but the argument is be argu in the wrong arena it is be argu in the arena of the militari versu the media and that not the problem let me give you some statist the height of the vietnam war the <unk> offens singl most import battl that occur in vietnam there were eighti report in the countri in saudi arabia we had two thousand ten second statist dure vietnam even a major battl when it wa report gener made it on

12,116,we begin in orlando florida where twelv year old gregori kingslei ha won hi case an hour ago a judg termin hi mother parent right and allow gregori to be adopt by the foster famili with whom he been live for the detail we go to c n ns charl jaco in orlando charl well susan your right it wa about an hour ago here in orlando florida judg thoma kirk rule two thing on the twelv year old gregori kingslei could termin hi mother parent right that is rachel <unk> parent right and secondli the young boi could be adopt by hi what were then foster parent georg and <unk> russ thi led to an immedi reaction and celebr in the courtroom thei were obvious veri veri happi with it as he hug hi attornei hug hi new mother it wa landmark case in a lot of wai the first time in u s histori that a twelv year old that a child of ani kind had been allow to bring a suit of thi kind and then afterward hi new mother made an offer i didnt realli enjoi the trial veri much im realli sorri that hi mother had to go through what she had to go through i wish it could have been done a simpler wai so that she didnt have to suffer like she did as a mother did it hurt to see you said suffer your word howd it make you feel as a mother i feel sorri for her why do you feel sorri becaus she lost her child if she come to you and sai i would like to see my child will you agre to that sure but if he want to the rule wa simpl the judg said that the case wa inde proven that rachel kingslei wa allegedli not a veri good mother and he felt that there were ground enough there under state statut of abandon to termin the parent right with me i have two of the <unk> in thi case in fact if it turn into a landmark case theyr the peopl who mai be written up in legal text first jerri blair jerri you were gregori attornei now a lot ha been made by a lot of peopl that weve open up a pandora box here and that kid ar go to end up file lawsuit on everyth from go out late at night to nintendo youv told me befor that that not the case that you feel the main effect of thi is go to be on children who ar in foster care who mai be abl to file lawsuit could you explain that pleas there ar a coupl of factor number on by give a child access to court you dont creat a new caus of action there isnt a caus of action for better toi or better school or whatev from children but there is a caus of action that recogn for termin of a parent slash child relationship when the parent ha been abus <unk> or ha abandon the child thi court all it did wa sai that when nobodi els protect a littl child then the child should be abl to go to court and protect himself here the state fail the parent first fail then the state fail and so the child wa left to hi own devic with us also is harri <unk> who wa on the other side of thi your on of the attornei for rachel kingslei the mother who lost in thi case your opinion have been quit differ you were tell me earlier as a father your more than a littl worri about thi set a preced and not a veri good on could you explain that i agre with your statement earlier that thi could be a pandora box although in thi case she indic that there wa alreadi a right for the you know a caus of action in term of termin of parent right we have to understand that thi is america the most <unk> countri in the world and what the judg ha done ha allow a twelv year old to come into court he ha allow a child to come into court on hi own so while in thi case the child came into court on a termin of parent right action i feel that the door ha been open for children to come into court and as we know there could be a <unk> of thing that children will feel just a strongli about as gregori kingslei now gregori russ felt in thi case so i disagre as a parent i am veri concern jerri what your respons to that i mean there ar a lot of parent watch thi who ar sai oh my god thi mai have just been an unusu adopt case but now that a child essenti ha been given legal stand to be the activ <unk> in a lawsuit theyr probabl <unk> in their boot figur if not liter i mean how do you react to what harri just said what you said is i think <unk> were not talk about the child have an absolut right of choic were talk about the child have stand a judg ha to decid thing if it frivol the judg is go to throw it out <unk> children have for year had recogn in crimin court that thei have fundament constitut right that requir that thei get certain thing in the court that adult get when children have commit crimin act that would effect their liberti thei ar entitl to counsel appoint counsel just like adult ar all were talk about here is allow a child to protect hi liberti interest in not be held up in the foster care system indefinit and that what thi case is about mr <unk> youv obvious gone right off and appeal thi thing a lot of peopl made a lot of nois about thi be a landmark case what your view do you think it a landmark case in term of a twelv year old be given stand to file a suit i definit feel that it an origin type of situat becaus im not awar of a child someon who a minor be allow to come in and actual be the petition i feel that the situat that we have in american law where we provid for guardian for children is the proper situat counselor just made a point about crimin case involv children that thei have the same right as adult howev i would sai were stand right on the step of the juvenil courthous where unless it an except situat if those children commit a crime thei will be dealt with as crimin and would not be face the same penalti as an adult and although there ar time when children can be tri as an adult there ha to be a hear and the state ha to come forward and prove certain thing so that those children can be tri as adult otherwis thei ar treat as children i would like the children to remain to be treat as children as long as possibl becaus i think that becaus of the emot type of situat and just from a social standpoint i think that you know we alwai hear about famili valu and thing of that natur and i just think that thi type of rule could lead to some veri contrari situat although in thi situat there mai have been some good reason i think as you go from jurisdict to jurisdict your go to find all type of rule and that what im concern about harri <unk> jerri blair thank you veri much for be with us as both of them have said weve got a landmark case here that been settl and on get the feel that whatev the outcom of the appeal thi is go to be on of those well thumb chapter in legal textbook in the year to come right now to repeat twelv year old gregori kingslei is now twelv year old shawn russ that hi new name he ha a new set of parent he ha succeed in hi case the first of it kind in the unit state of essenti divorc from a

thi is what bother peopl it not veri complic bill clinton ran for presid sai he want to repres the peopl who plai by the rule zoe baird broke the rule she admit she broke the rule she admit she knew she wa break the rule how can she run the justic depart which is in charg of enforc the rule well zoe baird made a mistak she acknowledg her mistak she disclos to the clinton peopl at the veri moment she wa under consider for a posit exactli what she had done and the clinton peopl decid that wa not a suffici mistak to justifi pull back ani propos nomin she ha paid the penalti for that mistak she ha she paid a fine she ha paid a fine although it is on of the veri first fine levi by the immigr and natur servic in the case of a domest worker it ha been the practic of the servic not to levi such fine in those case it is a civil fine it is not a crimin defens have paid that fine have shown that the law is equal and appli to her i think she will be in just as strong a posit as ani other attornei gener to appli the law fairli to everyon els but the reason she paid the fine is becaus of thi controversi becaus she been nomin there been a flood of letter and phone call from these senat i think theyr veri surpris the clinton peopl ar surpris im surpris i dont have ani kid from peopl who sai we have struggl hard we have to find peopl to take care of our kid and weve done it within the rule can you understand why these peopl feel so resent i can certainli understand why those who have compli with the rule all along would feel resent there mai be mani mani other peopl probabl ten time as mani peopl who have hire illeg alien and have never done anyth els about it you think most but that i grant you is no excus for what zoe baird did look mani and zoe baird ha paid her penalti and weve shown that the law appli equal to her as to anybodi els you know if thi wa anoth job even anoth import job in the administr i think peopl might not feel so nervou or unhappi about it but not onli is it the justic depart which <unk> the law the justic depart <unk> the immigr and natur servic how can she she probabl couldnt get hire as a low level i n s lawyer with thi thing in her record how can she supervis the i n s i think have paid the penalti have shown that the law appli even to the attornei gener designe that she in an excel posit to do that she in the posit to appli the law anywher to ani person ralph nader youv made it clear that on of the reason in fact the basic reason that you oppos zoe baird is becaus of her support of legal reform which would make it harder for lawyer to file those countless lawsuit that have made us a sue sue sue societi the american public support that legal reform why dont you support that nomin thank for put word in my mouth john what she support and what her compani aggress ha gone after is to take awai diminish the right of injur and sick peopl who have been wrongfulli harm to have those right to go into court for their justic that what she after thi isnt reform she also support a health insur brand that mr clinton doesnt agre with she support a compani aetna which is the most aggress anti consum compani in the insur industri she the gener counsel of aetna she the gener counsel and she also part of top manag as she carefulli told the committe on tuesdai not onli that she wa with gener electr which is a crass violat of law and occup safeti environment <unk> and procur fraud so the fact that she associ with the american privat sector is the big burden she carri no i want to quot lloyd cutler who told mark green the author in nineteen seventi five i want to make on thing clear we believ in the argument we us and we advanc so the kei is she not just do thi for the monei if she come up befor the committe and said look i repres all these odiou polici mani of which ar contrari to bill clinton campaign promis but i wa just do it for the monei that anoth thing i think she believ in what she wa advoc so your opposit ha not doe not come from what ha becom the headlin sourc of opposit name the hire of the illeg alien it is that she is oppos to the trial lawyer in thi countri and oppos to the kind of reform that would weaken if you will the capac of file lawsuit not at all john she ha no experi you just said that that on reason she ha no experi in the justic depart divis that she go to supervis she broke the law and by the wai no on could be emploi by the justic depart under her if thei broke the law the wai she broke the law let me ask a question youv help organ opposit have you got folk call in their senat i dont have to thi is an overwhelm topic of outrag my question is have you got folk call their senat no i dont have folk call their senat you dont have anyon call the senat i am urg peopl to make their posit known becaus bill clinton yesterdai said he want on the trial lawyer issu or on the nanni issu all the issu her lack of experi the immigr law and repres corpor anti consum and anti hold on lloyd your not us the nanni issu to mask lloyd i want to get back to the nanni issu if you want to sai someth about it id like to answer what ralph is just sai ralph is stigmat zoe baird becaus she repres corpor america ralph is veri much against the behavior of corpor america he doesnt recogn how much corpor america contribut to the energi and the product and the job creation in thi countri <unk> posit on tort reform ar she a director of the legal servic corpor she in favor of greater access to the court she against cap on punit damag or cap on now she is she ha been she ha never taken ani other posit than that and she testifi to all of that todai she particip in the quayl council let me go back to the nanni question becaus i think that what realli grip the other peopl here on thing that troubl me and i have to sai i would probabl vote for zoe baird at thi point but here on thing that doe troubl me when thi thing first happen she said well a lawyer had told her it wa o k to hire an illeg alien as long as you had an applic in now even if your not a lawyer which she is that make no sens at all there wa a huge controversi when we pass thi law in nineteen eighti six which made it illeg to hire an illeg alien if you could get around that law simpli by put in an applic the law would be nonsens how could ani intellig person believ that that wa legal well let me sai first that thi wa the advic of three differ lawyer to <unk> husband who a professor at the yale law school and he a smart man too and i dont understand how either on of them believ it listen for a moment to what the advic wa the advic wa that while it is quit true there is a civil penalti applic under the law and it is unlaw a civil violat under the law to hire an unauthor alien with knowledg that the alien is unauthor that in the case of domest worker household worker the practic of immigr lawyer and of the i n s wa for the immigr lawyer to file an applic to sponsor that individu that is to convinc the labor depart that you couldnt hire anyon els after advertis and that there wa a need for thi particular person and then to sponsor her for a green card an immigr which would make her a law worker if you disclos on the applic that the illeg alien wa alreadi work for you and that in due cours those applic would be grant and the work permit ha inde been grant on the basi but you cant thi isnt like appli to someth that your sure go to get after a limit amount of time most peopl dont get their applic grant so how could you think that quit wrong most peopl do get their applic grant if thei can show but she is go to be if thei can show that after advertis thei cannot hire a qualifi person all right lloyd thousand ten of thousand of peopl have follow thi particular procedur lloyd dont make excus for her she admit she wa wrong she and her husband make seven hundr thousand dollar a year thei could have hire mari poppin for heaven sake and there no thi question as to whether the driver had a legal connecticut driver licens a <unk> resid under connecticut law cannot have a legal driver licens he drive her in the cadillac to aetna all right iv got to cut you off lloyd youll get anoth you know under connecticut law thei dont ask nation when you appli for a driver licens all right he wa your wrong we cant keep go on thi well settl thi driver licens dure the break when we come back im go to ask whether there a doubl standard for democrat and republican nomine in the unit state senat welcom back to crossfir presid clinton nomine for attornei gener zoe baird broke the law by hire an illeg alien to care for her children should that disqualifi her that the debat around the countri and here on crossfir our guest ralph nader who oppos thi nomin and not just becaus of the nanni issu and lloyd cutler on of washington lead lawyer he wa white hous counsel and zoe <unk> boss in the carter administr and he just about her biggest backer in thi fight lloyd cutler here someth els that bother a lot of peopl and i havent heard ani explan for it right after the elect zoe baird and her husband paul <unk> fire thi peruvian coupl isnt that sort of crude no that wrong oh well correct it pleas correct me on that zoe baird origin and her husband hire thi peruvian coupl the husband left the wife the wife wa the babysitt the person who took care of the child right the husband wa a driver while zoe wa awai at work the wife wa devast by the departur of the husband and had difficulti perform her duti take care of the child and thi wa all i believ back well befor the elect i think im not absolut certain about that but in ani event the departur wa by mutual agreement becaus the babysitt wa no longer abl to perform her function and it had absolut noth to do with the fact that suddenli unexpectedli there wa a possibl for an administr job by zoe baird noth to do with it it happen well befor then all right im glad to hear it ralph the real opposit to zoe baird is that she not liber enough for some of the tradit democrat constitu and she actual be gone after on a ruse rather than go after her on her issu and polici john the justic depart ha been veri troubl it in a shambl it demor it been led by corpor lawyer for mani year it time for a peopl lawyer bill clinton promis a clean slate a high ethic tone put peopl first and who did we get for the next attornei gener design a corpor lawyer for gener electr and aetna two of the most reckless and irrespons corpor i know lloyd doesnt get veri disturb about corpor crime corpor safeti hazard he fought to delai airbag on the part of hi auto compani client and he repres petro chemic but i think it kei so it realli is philosophi it philosophi your oppos to well that what your known for and where doe that person come from did she have a record of repres farmer and tenant and women and children and consum and worker isnt it reprehens that the senat dont have the gut to stand up and sai then theyr oppos to her on philosophi and theyr us thi issu as the excus to stand up against her absolut put it here iv call them the well i take your hand anytim ralph but i dont agre with you the demo can parti wait a minut alan simpson im talk about the democrat who have abandon her on philosophi thei havent abandon her the kei with clinton now is whether he is go to have thi albatross around hi neck more call come in more letter more <unk> and more go ahead lloyd ralph you think of corpor america as evil number there ar lawyer i think of corpor crime as evil corpor crime is and corpor pollut is evil of cours it is and i agre with you and corpor fraud and corpor fraud is illeg but there ar lawyer for corpor who devot their time to improv the conduct of corpor not

wrongdo and made a full disclosur ani whistl <unk> who file a lawsuit after that should not be entitl to a share of the well have you back on thi on that all ralph let me ask you thi if her husband had been nomin under exactli the same condit do you realli think that hed be get the same kind of opposit that she is isnt there a lot of anti woman discrimin in thi whole thing not at all senat nanci kassebaum and five women in the hous of repres have come out against her barbara jordan ha come out against her i dont think you can accus the washington post and the new york time editori as be sexist do you think her husband would have been treat the same wai absolut and he mai be when he come up to testifi thei do agre on certain thing both of them agre that the fals claim act to protect against fraud were not go to discuss the fals claim act ralph is unconstitut why not im sorri were not go to discuss it that veri import she repres that in gener electr no let me ask lloyd cutler befor we have to take anoth break why everyth on the republican ar complain that there a doubl standard here when john tower wa up everi littl <unk> of hi wa brought up by the democrat and said thi disqualifi him now there actual <unk> and democrat ar sai well it bad but it not a deal breaker is there a doubl standard there ar mani mani case of cabinet nomine judici nomine who have commit on

with that with the u s attornei were almost out of time i want to ask lloyd cutler on last question zoe baird said at the hear that when she hire these illeg alien she as think like a mother and not like someon who might be a nomine for attornei gener and im afraid that remind me of when dan quayl said in nineteen eighti eight that when he join the nation guard to avoid the draft he didnt realiz he would somedai be stand there as a vice presidenti nomine now we all laugh and scof when dan quayl said that isnt it sort of similar well zoe baird wasnt think that she might somedai be a nomine for attornei gener had she been think of that at the time she would have obei the law she might veri well have done someth differ and endur the inabl to find a compet babysitt at the time she wa take on the biggest job in the world she is a mother that a fact of life she cant defend herself on the ground that as a woman she should be excus where a man would not be excus she clearli wa ask for sympathi on that basi wasnt she she wa state a fact and in fact it wa brought out by diann feinstein she initi the line of question about she said im not ask you about the legal situat i want to know

gener presid clinton been presid for on dai and i find myself agre with you michael i dont know what wrong well it iv been mean to comment on your <unk> support of everi singl thing that presid clinton doe it get rather <unk> i know it ever sinc he been in offic the fact is is that thi process ha becom pain what she did wa wrong but what i think is happen is that peopl ar oppos her becaus she too conserv not becaus of thi nanni issu some peopl ar oppos her becaus of thi tort busi but most peopl ar genuin upset about the nanni issu there is and furthermor i think the process is fine even zoe baird would sai the process is healthi it brought thi problem to attent a lot of peopl ar think about it who ought to from the left im mike kinslei good night for crossfir and from the right

noah adam and im linda wertheim on capitol hill todai the senat move to confirm fourteen more clinton appointe nine of them cabinet secretari but quick and smooth confirm is not like for attornei gener designe zoe baird on her second dai of confirm hear support for her began to erod late thi afternoon senat alan simpson the assist minor leader and co author of the nation princip immigr law said he would vote against her nomin baird ha apolog and paid a civil fine for hire two illeg immigr to work in her household but neg public reaction is set up the possibl of the clinton administr first polit fight on capitol hill npr nina totenberg report for democrat the nomin is a horribl dilemma with presid clinton in hi first week in offic no democrat want to undercut him but the constitu phone call ar flood senat offic against the nomine the offic of california newli elect senat dian feinstein ha receiv fifteen hundr call against the nomine and thirti three in support other senat report a similar trend and feinstein who just yesterdai said baird would be confirm said todai she hope to be abl to vote for the nomine the phone call radio talk show respons and mail ha the republican jump ship todai senat nanci kassebaum the onli femal republican senat withdrew her previou endors of baird and said she would vote no on the nomin onc it reach thi type of fire storm you cant get it behind you and particularli as i sai in a depart which i think must hold up the highest standard so as a role model she just doesnt qualifi she herself could probabl provid a real servic to presid clinton by withdraw her nomin a number of other republican some privat some publicli said thei too would oppos that put the democrat in the posit of choos whether to betrai their new presid or appear to flout the spirit of reform that he and some of them ran on the good new said on democrat is that nobodi want to vote against her the bad new is that nobodi want to vote for her democrat sai the more junior member of the senat ar particularli skittish as on put it about take a fall for the presid a new experi for democrat who have never befor had a democrat presid to work with that ha led to consider discuss about baird withdraw her nomin todai senat herb kohl of wisconsin ask her first how she expect if confirm to have the moral author to lead the justic depart thi is a demonstr that the law doe appli to everyon i wa wrong to have broken the law thi should not be done by other i dont recommend it to other i dont excus other i dont excus myself clearli and i believ that you want the attornei gener of thi countri to be respect as much as anybodi els in govern becaus that person is a citizen repres with respect to law and order and justic in thi countri have you ask yourself whether or not you might serv that order best by withdraw your nomin i dont believ that that would be appropri i think that my overal record give me the potenti to be a great attornei gener that thi episod while i dont want to diminish it excus it it wa an episod which is a civil violat when i paid the penalti the penalti were two thousand nine hundr dollar im not try to sai that it small or unimport im just try to sai that i think that the power of my overal record and the potenti that i have to serv thi countri and to serv thi presid as attornei gener should overrid the particular incid in my mind in my judgment so far no democrat ha publicli <unk> from the baird nomin and the republican on the judiciari committe ar preserv their option inde rank republican orrin hatch remain <unk> most vocifer support todai accus what he call left wing group of gener the phone call against the nomin hatch refus to specifi what group he wa talk about and other senat sai privat

south dakota made it offici for himself let sai that you had that the justic depart decid to do a strike forc a lot of raid on small businessmen would you feel fulli comfort on go on nation televis and tell the american peopl were go to start have these raid on small busi ye absolut i mean i believ that the law should be enforc and that the immigr law should be enforc and i believ thei should be enforc even handedli and i have no problem with that well thi is a line of concern that i have is your effect and im sorri to sai that it will it forc me to vote against you i know my rank member mai reach the opposit conclus and i think that the gener consensu in the press is that you will be confirm ill be work with you but i want you to know and everybodi to know that my concern ar your effect the senat judiciari committe hear will continu tomorrow with testimoni from nomine <unk> husband yale law professor paul <unk> he did much of the work in hire the illeg immigr,

how doe the presid follow up plu actor alan <unk> recal basebal glori dai in a new movi now here larri king good even from washington call it the world shortest honeymoon the clinton presid didnt last on full dai befor a polit crisi hi choic for attornei gener prove the equival of box offic poison zoe baird had admit hire illeg alien for <unk> while avoid the proper tax as her stori unfold on televis <unk> <unk> lit up and her odd of confirm dwindl what went wrong with the zoe baird nomin and how doe the presid minim the damag two distinguish member of the senat panel that question ms baird ar with us tonight in washington senat howel heflin democrat of alabama and a former judg from denver in hi home state of colorado is republican senat hank brown and both ar member of the senat judiciari committe what happen howel what went wrong well i think that she enter realli in effect a plea of guilti and so mani peopl across the nation just didnt think that there were mitig circumst thei associ themselv with <unk> thei associ themselv with tax form with paper and mani women have to fill that out the husband leav those thing to them and there wa a tremend outcri from the women against her wa thi also the natur of her appoint if she had been appoint to hud or treasuri do you think it would have been the same i dont know iv had it both wai iv heard argument and thought about it in both wai i think it would have been the same were you lean for confirm well at the time i alwai try to reserv my opinion till after all the evid is in but i had strong and compel reserv it would have been difficult to vote for her i would have like to have heard her husband give hi explan to listen to the lawyer and to the coupl involv and i think thei were all go to be wit well not necessarili but thei had been request whether thei would have end up be wit remain to be seen the husband would have i know senat were you between a rock and a hard place here senat brown in that a lot of conserv republican like zoe baird zoe baird is a bright bright woman ha a lot of experi and what i like best about her is some real manag experi as you know the justic depart ha nineti two thousand employe the problem i think were two thing on the administr miscalcul thei had thought at least their spokesman indic that zoe didnt know what she did wa wrong it turn out that shed had legal advic she knew it wa wrong befor she did it and went ahead anywai and the second thing that happen is some of the liber group abandon her and when thei left she simpli wa left without a base where were you i wa concern about the infract actual there were six differ violat failur to pai social secur tax to withhold social secur tax failur to fill out an i nine form failur to fill out a withhold form a wide varieti of problem over and abov hire the illeg alien i wa concern about that i want to listen to all the wit but frankli i wa lean against her if those charg turn out to be accur ar you sai hank that had it gone to the senat shed have lost i think so and the reason i think so is the work men and women of thi countri that have to put up with some of these law and thei ar a pain in the neck thought if thei have to do it sure the attornei gener ha to all right all the televis network c n n includ show pictur of senat offic answer phone call strongli against ms baird why did you let those camera in you didnt have to let them in some ar sai you let them in to back up a decis you were go to make and thi made it easier what camera in where what do you mean in the camera into senat offic where we saw secretari and press repres answer call against zoe baird i dont know if thei did it in my offic i dont know thei made the decis staff i wa at the hear room so i dont know what happen but you didnt sai let them in or dont let them in i didnt make the decis on wai or the other it all right with me if thei let them in did your offic get a lot of call oh ye we got a tremend number of call all right now what gener thi what do you think gener it hank some think the talk show around america gener it well larri you know politician cant sai no to televis i suspect that while thei didnt come to my offic theyd probabl be welcom in most ani what i think happen wa peopl whod had the experi of fill out these form and thei ar a mess and a pain in the neck just simpli react from their own circumst and figur that if thei had to do it by golli the attornei gener who wa go to enforc it sure ought to and frankli the flood of call we got at our offic i think were like those in other offic thei were not necessarili an organ campaign thei were simpli ordinari work peopl so the charg that thi wa some liber movement or that some talk show host across america were spur it on as thei did with the hous and the bank you dont bui number i think it came from just the heart of the peopl and their own concern we got call from my state offic from small town all around where there wouldnt have been an organ effort or wouldnt have been a talk show it wa just peopl just had deep feel about it i mean thei put themselv in the same posit and said what would happen to me you know and thei look at her circumst now what doe a call mean to a senat well we pai attent to call in particular to those call where you know there not an organ campaign weve had call i reckon on the bork hear i must have gotten fifti thousand phone call but thei either came from on organ group or anoth organ group and you know and you know it you can tell it thei give them the word all thei do is parrot the same thing and time and time again it the same messag and you know it come from an organ effort but when these were come in with differ messag all over the whole area you knew that it wa come from their heart and mind hank do you read it the same wai i think the call were essenti that im sure there were some organ call but the bulk of them were simpli volunt and the other aspect of thi i think that wa so compel wa if shed made a mistak and hadnt been awar of the law i think a lot of peopl would have bought the request for forgiv but the fact that she consult a lawyer first knew it wa wrong knew it wa illeg and chose to do it anywai i think put a cap on it what impact if ani did senat <unk> public statement and former congresswoman barbara jordan public statement have if ani im sure thei had some but i went to a democrat caucu befor id heard of senat <unk> wed heard of barbara jordan and the spontan peopl who were speak up liber middl of the road conserv democrat were speak up no wai no wai thei were just sai that she shouldnt be confirm she ought to withdraw thei were sai that did senat kassebaum influenc you at all senat brown well i think all republican and i suspect most american have a great deal of respect for senat kassebaum veri well thought of but i think senat heflin ha put hi finger on it it wa the reaction of the peopl senat kassebaum and barbara jordan repres their parti ar thought to be mainstream in their parti and to the extent that it <unk> senat come out against her i suspect she had both of them had an influenc well get a break talk about the polit effect if ani on clinton and who might be the next appointe well be take your call as well alan <unk> is still to come mondai night hi first appear sinc leav the post the former secretari of state lawrenc eagleburg will be here secretari of state eagleburg mondai night on larri king live with your phone call dont go awai im sad about it but it wasnt agon im just veri im sad about it and i take full respons as i said in my statement for the wai the evalu wa done it wa i still have a veri high regard for her she is an extraordinari person and i feel veri badli about it but im respons for it welcom back to larri king live well be go to your phone call in a littl while our guest ar senat howel heflin democrat of alabama and in denver senat hank brown republican of colorado both member of the veri prestigi senat judiciari committe what now senat heflin presid clinton said todai at hi first cabinet meet at the end of it that he go to spend the afternoon now look at <unk> to be attornei gener what do you expect i suspect hell realli thoroughli investig it ask hi team transit team to find the best qualifi person and he sai that he want the best qualifi person and i think that that what it should be do you expect it to be a woman well i think if everyth equal if it come down well sai to four peopl two men two women if theyr all equal i think hell stai with a woman but i think he go to seek the most qualifi individu what do you think hank well the presid paint himself in a corner on thi he pledg in the campaign to have about half of hi cabinet women he far short of that goal and there a lot of pressur on him to have on but the realiti is there ar numer veri well qualifi women i suspect itll be a woman but he ha to act quickli and i think he ha to make sure thi time that thei have the right qualif why didnt thei read thi right howel what do you think wa the what went wrong in transit well i think thei were in a littl bit too big a hurri and there were sever peopl that he want that turn him down ye i understand at least two and i think thi wa a sort of a late in decis and obvious thei didnt evalu it properli and i think it theyll benefit as a result of their error how long senat brown should we be without an attornei gener in other word while we want an excel appoint should it also be expedit i think it need to be expedit but the realiti is that thi govern is go to function just fine without on for a while thei have abl peopl that can handl the lower spot and run it as a matter of fact i think peopl would be surpris how well the countri would run without congress for a littl while so i dont see ani major emerg here but he doe i think have to make sure that the appoint that come out is the right on when do you expect a nomin i would think it would be a coupl of week at least oh realli ye ye unless on of those that turn him down got back in ye well that might be but i think otherwis itll be that the problem theyv got is that it take a while to get an f b i check done if your look at a new person so thei mai well have their hand ti to someon theyv alreadi check out san mateo california as we go to call for senat heflin and senat brown hello thank you larri i want to state first that i thought that the action of the senat and the public wa anoth exampl of a great democraci in action bring forth an issu howev as an old naval <unk> iv discov that the recoveri from a mistak often make a more profession <unk> and im disappoint that the senat didnt pick up thi theme zoe <unk> recoveri the fact that she he sai she handl herself well in make thi mistak admit it come forward with it be honest about it well that wa to her benefit but it wa also a veri seriou situat particularli in view of the immigr law and how thei ar to be enforc the method of enforc is through employ sanction and these sanction were consid a long time you know at the time that thi bill wa adopt thei gave amnesti to three million illeg alien in thi countri which i oppos i wa against that but nevertheless the concept of employ sanction in my judgment wa a weak method of enforc but thei would have had tremend cost have to emploi all of the law enforc agent that would be necessari in take the blame as he did do you think senat brown that presid clinton handl it well todai i think thi isnt go to count against the presid sure there wa a mistak but if he move ahead and handl it right it not go to hurt him but i do disagre to some extent about what happen here i think what wa wrong wasnt that she made a mistak what wa wrong is that she knew it wa illeg at the time and chose to do it and in addit it wa compound by the failur to file social secur tax realli five other violat and also in her incom group to a lot of peopl that look strang well the thing you have to be amaz at is if a yale law professor and an exception bright woman who a corpor counsel for a major corpor cant figur out these law how ar the ordinari work men and women of thi countri go to do it to pasadena hello hi if presid clinton hire anoth femal would he not be fill a quota posit than just fill the proper posit well basic i dont think there ani quota in thi he want to try to have a broad divers of appoint and that what theyr seek i mean there no question todai that work women ar fill job from execut posit in corpor to everi aspect of life and i think it a recognit of the fact that women ar take an import posit in our societi todai and it somewhat of a recognit he ran on the campaign that wa part of hi campaign peopl vote for him for it peopl vote for him on that do you think it a quota hank it pretti clearli is he commit himself in the campaign to have roughli half the cabinet women the fact is he far short of that he is in a box but the realiti is there an enorm amount of veri bright capabl abl well train women attornei that can do a great job here well be right back with senat howel heflin and hank brown and more of your phone call then the brilliant alan <unk> next week paula poundston will be with us the veri funni paula poundston bill moyer and dont forget mondai night the former secretari of state larri eagleburg dont go awai i think the presid did receiv a report from the transit team i do not have all of the detail on that report have you tri to get the detail and were try to figur out exactli what happen whatev the exact minut by minut detail it hard to reconstruct at ani time it clear that the transit process did make a mistak back to your call for senat heflin and brown ottawa canada hello hello larri hi ye america is respect worldwid as a countri of law dont you think that thi reput would be tarnish by have an attornei gener who admit to have broken the law well i think it certainli is someth that should be consid and weve had peopl that have been put up that have admit do thing and then withdrawn befor the ginsburg nomin for the suprem court it certainli there mai be traffic violat or someth like that that but thi to me wa seriou and i agre that certainli you would expect the attornei gener to be vigor and imparti and try to seek equal justic and i think it would have been a handicap have you been ask for ani recommend by the wai as a promin democrat former judg no i havent been ask for ani nomin independ you know im sorri go ahead hank well what happen here is ms baird had consult an attornei who appar had extens background in thi area she wa told that there had never been a penalti brought for someon in connecticut for thi crime even though she knew it wa wrong could it harm our reput ye but i think you can also understand that thi ha not been enforc veri vigor independ missouri hello ye my question wa to the republican from denver is thi go to be characterist of bill clinton after he made a decis to give in to pressur of social <unk> group well i think the onli fair answer to that is to wait and see there ar a lot of pressur on a presid it quit true that he move quickli in thi instanc and i think you mai well see some reaction to how quickli thei move realli somewhat befor ms baird had realli had a chanc to give her whole case but the realiti is thi is a tough busi and i think the book still open on how the presid will ultim respond the republican to their credit did not do ani hack hack job on ani of these peopl did thei i think there wa a strong feel that she deserv a fair chanc to make her case and the realiti wa that among the other nomine thei were almost thei pretti well breez through didnt thei thei did inde and i think there a strong feel that the administr should have a chanc to name peopl of it own philosophi to the job theyll be judg on the job thei do as you mention earlier thi is go to be a tough call the next appointe it ha to be someon dont you think from the standpoint of the presid that liter ha to be approv oh ye oh ye i dont think he can stand anoth defeat on thi and i hope it come from somebodi that got a background in judici matter as well it would be desir to have somebodi that got a background with crimin prosecut you know the attornei gener main link from the public is in connect with enforc of the law and the crimin law drug and crime todai ar primari problem that we have and we ought to have somebodi that had some experi in fight drug and crime lo angel hello hello first of all i think that that law is pretti poor for the home ye for a busi where revenu come in but not for a home but i just feel were a nation of such small mind peopl to take what i consid such a small issu when we have such huge problem that zoe baird would have been so capabl with her energi and manag skill to take to the depart of justic which is cumbersom doe need govern overhaul she would have done a wonder job and were talk about someth that shouldnt even be bother with in the home i think you make two good point there on manag experi is a critic factor here becaus youv got nineti two thousand peopl to direct and guid and inspir and secondli the truth is there were six violat here mani of which most american simpli wouldnt know how to cope or put up with the realiti is a lot of <unk> violat thi law simpli becaus thei dont know how to fill out all those form or arent even awar that all of them ar requir probabl what we ought to do is go back and look at those law provid some sort of exempt for the nitpick aspect of the paperwork here think so ye i think frankli i oppos the law i thought the law had a lot of mistak in it the amnesti of three million illeg alien when it came along the idea of forc the employ to be the enforc offic basic and not to do it to me there is also danger of discrimin if somebodi speak with an accent the averag person draw back i dont know thei mai be an illeg alien and theyd be veri cautiou about it and there could be discrimin in regard to that i think the whole law need to be <unk> and probabl will be well i hope so ye columbu ohio last call for senat heflin and brown and then alan <unk> hello ye i would like to ask your two senat if thei have such high standard for zoe baird what ar thei go to do about mr session of the f b i and hi ethic mr session well i think everybodi got seriou concern about judg session and all of the thing if theyr true now he hasnt had an opportun yet to present hi side if true if should he leav the f b i well if theyr all true ye i think so can you forc him out well he ha a ten year appoint and i had look into the method it would be larg up to the presid i believ and the new attornei gener right well the presid i think he work for the attornei gener i think it a presidenti appoint what do you think thi is hypothet senat brown if the charg about mr session were true well the old attornei gener issu a veri strong reprimand in veri direct languag indic hed

wa elect chairman fridai on the third ballot by the republican nation committe ag forti five barbour wa polit director at the white hous under presid reagan and sinc then ha been a washington lobbyist he is republican nation <unk> from mississippi and wa describ thi wai in hi nomin speech on of our own who understand the republican parti from the ground up from the bottom to the top from the precinct to the white hous he is on of us befor barbour wa elect depart nation chairman rich bond challeng whoever succeed him to take the abort issu out of polit ar we will to stake our parti fortun on a singl issu is it the job of the republican parti to lead the crusad mr barbour thi is your first televis interview sinc your elect congratul thank you bob ar you readi to follow the advic by your predecessor rich bond and activ move to elimin ani mention of abort from the platform of the parti in nineteen nineti six you know rich wa chairman for a year and made hi view known yesterdai and im sure he got a good strong basi of that but were not go to do anyth about our platform until nineteen nineti six we dont have a chanc to do that iv said throughout thi campaign that my own view is that we cannot let abort or ani other issu be a litmu test if we let abort be the threshold issu of republican we need our head examin i understand that posit but do you have an opinion on whether there should be ani mention of abort in the platform i mean mr bond think it should be elimin do you think it should be elimin or not be elimin i think the biggest problem we had in nineteen nineti two is that the white hous impos just stuf down a posit on abort that wa an <unk> posit on the convent that we did not realli have the convent decid what the abort plank ought to be when nineteen nineti six come around well see what the polit fact about abort ar what is at issu you know at on time the onli question wa should abort be legal or illeg but in the wake of the webster decis the mississippi decis the pennsylvania decis there ar a lot more issu that ar relev todai in term of how much abort should be limit regul by the state and in nineteen nineti six i dont have a crystal ball to know what the issu will be i do know that right now we need to talk more about the issu that unit us as republican and not let ani on issu be a litmu test mr chairman i want to make on more try at that you said that the abort issu should be submerg to it right place pleas defin for me right place well that it not be a litmu test that we not have peopl believ that if thei disagre with the republican platform posit on abort that somehow theyr second class republican im pro life but there ar million and million of good republican who ar pro choic who ar everi bit as good republican as i you dont have to agre with halei barbour on everyth to be a good republican and that on thing that our chairman and our parti ha to stand for were the conserv parti in thi countri but we ar a broad mainstream parti and were a divers parti in a parti big enough to elect a presid of the unit state everybodi not go to agre on everyth do you think we shouldnt expect to do you think that your predecessor as i detect a note of critic in what you said hed been chairman and suddenli on the wai out he make thi <unk> statement do you think he made a mistak number i wa not be you mai have detect a note of critic but it wa not intend just rich ha been chairman he ha a right to hi own opinion and to share with the committe what he think after hi year as chairman of the r n c as i come in i have my own experi which ar differ from <unk> but no he got it like i wa sai a minut ago we dont have to agre on everyth were not suppos to agre on everyth if everybodi agre with me itd be a mighti small parti veri veri briefli and then i want to move to larger other issu wa it a construct thing statement for rich bond to have made at thi particular moment ye or no i think rich wa express himself about a real concern all right that doe truli exist in the parti and to the degre of put it on the tabl there noth wrong with that i dont want to sai it wa not construct it just hi give hi opinion all right mr chairman i wa present in saint loui for the last two dai just got back to washington and i found a lot of your support were veri much afraid of the fact that phylli schlafli and the right and the pro life peopl were support your princip oppon spencer abraham the former michigan chairman for chairman is the kiss is the endors of phylli schlafli now a neg in the parti oh i dont know about that i dont know that phylli schlafli took ani role in the thing until right at the veri last so i dont know i think the reason that i won wa that i appeal to a broad divers group in the parti geograph philosoph we were all gener conserv who were run but i think peopl felt comfort with me thei want a chairman who could be both an effect spokesman to articul our messag and a nut and bolt organiz leader like we had when rai bliss wa chairman and i think peopl vote for me becaus thei thought i could do that and not becaus thei were try to vote against somebodi els these were all good candid good peopl who have a lot to contribut ar you uncomfort with the role of the christian coalit in the parti the role of conserv activist doe that bother you do you think it is a problem for the futur of the republican parti you know i come from the bibl belt i come from mississippi that where i live as you said i live in <unk> citi mississippi conserv christian ar veri activ in our parti down there theyr a big part of our base theyr an asset to our parti i think the same is true all over the countri peopl do get concern whether it the christian coalit or ani other group if there is an impress that somebodi is try to take over the parti to exclud peopl we dont need takeov or purg but i dont want to exclud anybodi the christian coalit or conserv christian or whatev you want to call the group that is a big asset to our parti thei need to be welcom under our big tent thei ar welcom under our big tent and thei do a lot for us mr chairman you were support by the most liber element in the republican nation committe who ar not all that element but the who ar not all that liber but thei were there what commit did you make to have peopl like <unk> <unk> of pennsylvania support you what promis did you make them that you who ha a reput deserv or not as a conserv to get that kind of support well of cours i am a conserv bob and i think <unk> <unk> and a lot of other peopl who dont agre with me on everi issu support me becaus thei felt comfort with me that im an <unk> that i recogn that our parti a coalit that it is a broad mainstream parti it gener a conserv parti and that i reach out to the peopl that dont agre with me on everyth <unk> and i have alwai gotten along on the committe and she alwai treat me fairli and iv alwai treat her fairli when i wa at the white hous with presid reagan republican all across the spectrum found that i knew my job wa to try to help them get elect to make our parti stronger and to make ronald reagan stronger and i think that experi with me is what led peopl who ar mayb not as conserv as i to vote for me mr chairman i want to try to get from you what you consid your toughest problem in put back or creat a parti that can win elect in nineteen nineti four and nineteen nineti six im go to do it thi wai you have said the republican parti must return to it principl impli that under bush it lost it principl on of your major figur in the parti pat buchanan ha said that the g o p base todai is rock solid now explain that contradict or conflict and where you want to take the parti well you know i dont know that there exactli what pat said or whether that is a contradict i believ thi is the case that the peopl who vote for us in nineteen eighti and eighti four and eighti eight didnt chang their mind after the nineteen eighti eight elect about the conserv view thei had about govern it wa by nineteen nineti two thei werent sure that we still believ in what theyd vote for in eighti and eighti four and eighti eight and i think what we have to do is we have to demonstr to the american peopl and project our principl so that we regain our posit in thi countri as a parti of principl and a parti of idea and i think we lost that dure between eighti eight and nineti two i cant sai that it wa becaus mayb wed been in offic too long mayb we didnt have fresh idea mayb the democrat congress did everyth thei could do to thwart georg bush mayb all of those thing ar true noth i can do about that and finger point doesnt make doesnt do anybodi ani good but i do know thi peopl need to know over the next two to and four year what we republican stand for what we believ in and we need to emphas the principl that unit us so that peopl in nineteen nineti four when we have these elect ar like thei were in nineteen eighti four and sai well i know what a republican is i know what thei want to do i know where thei want to take the govern that the biggest challeng weve got mr chairman the question of gai right is a veri hot on todai in washington in the militari and in thi countri it probabl the top social issu go right now pat buchanan again to quot him after sai that the parti base is rock solid he sai that gai right ar anti biblic and amor do you agre with that well i didnt hear exactli what pat said becaus that what he said iv been out here iv been try to anti biblic and amor get eighti three vote i think that in a piec in the wall street journal i think most american absolut recogn that thi is not should not be foist on the american peopl as an accept altern lifestyl that it like be <unk> or someth and i think if that the republican parti ha to stand for the proposit that were not go to let bill clinton go out and make a payoff to a special interest group without ani consider for nation secur without ani consider for the effect or order in the militari in the face of the advic the experienc advic yeah of the joint chief of staff i think the republican parti go to support the joint chief of staff posit i respect it and i think it right so mr chairman your sai thi ha becom a major issu between the parti or at least between the republican parti and the clinton white hous and thi is go to be thi is go to continu to be on of the great social issu go into the next two year as you try to reform the republican parti is that correct <unk> i would sai thi ha becom a great issu between the american peopl versu the clinton white hous now what it durat will be and how i would describ it as great and all these other thing i just dont tend to character thing that wai but i think right now the american peopl think that the posit presid clinton taken is not the right posit that it out of step with what ought to be done that it bad for the militari and theyr oppos to it and i think republican ar as usual in tune with the think of the averag american mr barbour ar you afraid of your parti be call the parti of intoler becaus i know a lot of your colleagu and some member of the nation committe ar i am afraid of ani time our parti appear to be intoler of divers were a divers parti if you so you could get in troubl im not afraid of the name peopl call me you can call me anyth you want to what i am afraid of is if the american peopl get the impress that were not an inclus parti so thi gai we have to make thi gai issu could be a danger issu for you then well if you stand for your principl and make sure that you dont come across as intoler but that your be for what is right and what you believ in then im not worri about it i think that you have to be for what right but at the same time not beat peopl over the head with it that peopl who dont agre with me on an issu as long as theyr gener in tune with the republican posit theyr fine ronald reagan us to sai when i wa at the white hous a fellow who agre with you eighti percent of the time is your friend and alli he not some twenti percent traitor and i think we as a as parti leader we have to think like that im not try to be the head of a special interest group im go to be the chairman of a polit parti and it divers mr chairman on of your oppon a member of the nation committe told me on fridai that you were you probabl the edg that gave you the victori wa probabl the support by the polit consult who ar afraid that under abraham thei would be cut off the payrol what is your polici go to be on hire polit consult at the republican nation committe well my polici is that gener we will not hire polit consult were certainli go to do awai with the idea that there can be <unk> in perpetu where peopl were just hire on an open end base sometim it not in the best interest of the parti or ani other busi to hire staff and to pai for infrastructur to do a project that it cheaper more effect and more effici to contract it out when we do that and we will do it sometim were not go to get in the poll busi and were not go to get in the print busi or the product of materi busi like brochur and that sort of stuff so and were go to contract that out and when we do were go to do it on a bid basi an <unk> basi were go to have fewer consult but we will have some consult becaus there ar go to be certain thing so that were just not go to spend the monei to do ourselv so mr chairman you agre with bob dole who consid himself todai the number on republican in the countri and he mai be correct that you should be a nut and bolt chairman period and you shouldnt run around critic senat member of congress about their vote on bill and about their polit posit am i right in that <unk> i think i said earlier in the show that i think the reason i got elect chairman is that committe member saw me as abl to be both a nut and bolt organiz leader and an effect spokesman for the parti i think that the chairman job to do both i dont think the chairman of the r n c is the head of the shadow govern the shadow would be the shadow prime minist well can i ask you thi sir will you ever sure critic a republican senat as dole sai you should not well of cours were go to do what best in the best interest of the parti sometim legisl decis mai have to be made where the best legisl decis is to try to work out a compromis but that mai not be what the republican parti want and im go to be talk about what the republican parti want you know on thing we learn in the bush administr presid bush wa hurt so mani time by compromis with congress i guess sometim it wa necessari but polit compromis with thi congress is like pai the <unk> to eat you last i didnt get the and that not someth im go to do veri much i didnt get the answer on that that mean you will critic a republican sometim if it necessari i think we will critic bad decis by the govern and sometim republican mai be support that were not go to go out and pick out republican to critic but if the clinton administr doe someth that we think is bad polici even if some republican support it that not go to stop me from critic and talk about what the republican ar for mr chairman weve got we have to take a break we have to take a break for messag and when we come back it will be with the big question for the new republican nation chairman mr chairman the big question the washington post thi morn treat your elect in a i thought a rather curiou wai the headlin wa lobbyist elect g o p nation chairman will you tell us now that when your term end probabl in four year that you will not return to the lobbyist trade <unk> i dont know what ill do at the end of four year hopefulli well have a republican presid in the white hous at the end of four year becaus that my job to win elect in nineti three nineti four nineti five and nineti six but as you know on my elect ill be sell have been elect ill be sell my interest in my law firm to my partner ill <unk> my relationship with it i wont have ani ti to it busi ti to it at all or financi ti so i dont know what ill be do at the end of nineti six in other word you dont feel that the ethic rule that presid clinton ha put in for ron brown as secretari of commerc that he cannot lobbi for four year after hi offic that doesnt appli to the chairman of the republican nation committe of cours ron brown when he wa chairman of the democrat nation committe practic law the whole time he never stop i thought that wa inappropri and that why im not go to practic law as chairman of the r n c but should but it is differ work but should the ethic than work for the feder govern so you mai go back to lobbi in other word i mai i mai go back to <unk> citi to practic law i mai i dont know what ill do hopefulli well have a republican administr and mayb ill get a chanc to particip in it just like bill brock did just quickli most of the last committe meet wa held behind close door secret ballot ar you go to continu that close door type of activ as nation chairman well i think therel be both some close and some open press stuff i think it good for the parti when we talk strategi to talk personnel that sort of stuff that it be behind close door i think it onli fair it stupid to telegraph to the democrat what were go to be do mr chairman our <unk> to win elect and two second two second will you bring in congression district represent on the nation committe no sir o k were a feder of state parti thank you veri and thank you veri much halei barbour congratul on your elect my partner and i will be back with some comment after these messag bob i think we heard a war cry for the new chairman of the republican nation committe gai in the militari absolut not he said were go to have to look at thi issu veri veri carefulli he said it a matter of clinton versu the republican parti it clinton versu the whole countri on thi issu <unk> halei barbour <unk> the issu of abort he <unk> the whole question of the christian coalit and the right wing of the republican parti he certainli didnt want to follow the veri contenti line taken by rich bond he want to bring the parti togeth he doesnt want to throw out ultimatum to the right wing but you know i wa surpris bob he did not finess my question about bob dole he indic veri strongli that as chairman he is go to take posit and he is go to carri hi fight if necessari to the republican minor in the congress and assert the parti posit i hope bob dole heard that mr barbour ha been in polit all hi life he is undoubtedli the most <unk> nation chairman the republican ever had as far as go on televis goe and when your on a <unk> when your out of power that is a major asset for a nation chairman im robert novak,
56,221,as american debat thi week whether or not to lift the ban on homosexu in the militari mani concern and fear were rais those against lift the ban argu that openli gai member of the militari would creat disciplin and privaci problem gregori <unk> a research psychologist at the univers of california at davi ha studi attitud toward gai he sai he found sever reason why peopl ar uncomfort with homosexu for some heterosexu their discomfort stem from the fact that thei feel that thei ar good moral peopl it veri import for them to have a sens of themselv as be veri good moral religi peopl and their religion or their religi leader have taught them for a long time that homosexu is realli the <unk> of what is good other peopl consid homosexu to be someth that all of their friend and their famili ar veri oppos to and so and becaus it import for them to be like and accept by their friend and famili thei take a stand that goe along with the crowd for some peopl it the idea that homosexu creat a sens of uneas in them becaus thei mai feel a bit uncomfort about their own sexual or thei mai simpli feel a littl bit insecur about their own masculin if theyr a man or feminin if theyr a woman and becaus homosexu is so much identifi as be oppos to our cultur standard of masculin and feminin thei find that thi a veri challeng thing for them and so thei feel uncomfort for that reason im realli struck by the fact when you hear peopl talk about the issu of gai in the militari openli gai peopl in the militari the discuss veri quickli turn to discuss of what it would be like to be in close quarter on a navi ship or in the shower especi thi talk of shower and the idea of i get a sens of the idea that peopl feel veri vulner when thi issu come up expos you know liter liter expos yeah it somewhat iron when you think that were talk about peopl who ar in perhap the most power fight forc on earth and their real fear have not to do with go our into battl and be in combat and risk their live but rather in be seen in some state of <unk> by anoth person who thei feel might be attract to them i think that a lot of those <unk> ar express by male by heterosexu male in the militari and i have to think that it come somewhat from their sens that thei might be place in the same posit that thei perceiv women to be place in by heterosexu men thei feel concern that perhap thei would be sexual harass or sexual molest while theyr in the shower that thei would possibl be attack and <unk> i think that there realli not veri much basi for that you have to rememb that gai men have grown up throughout their live be in situat where thei have to be undress or <unk> or do other sort of privat function around other men around heterosexu men and theyv had to learn to be veri circumspect in fact i would guess that most gai men in those situat ar probabl go to be more discreet and more circumspect than heterosexu men ar ar these attitud these attitud that peopl hold ar thei base on experi with gai peopl or more specul about what might happen you know that an interest question when we look at peopl who have had heterosexu peopl who have had person contact with lesbian and gai men we find that thei ar to a great extent veri support of gai peopl when we look at nation opinion data and break it down accord to whether a heterosexu person know gai peopl or not the heterosexu who do know someon who gai ar much more like to be support of gai right and of gai peopl in variou situat than ar those who dont know someon who gai and it interest becaus that translat into just about everi demograph group even the group that ar usual fairli hostil such as peopl who ar veri highli religi veri strongli fundamentalist christian for exampl even in that group if you break it down accord to those who know gai peopl and those who dont you find that those who do know gai peopl ar much more accept in gener i think that for most american and probabl about seventi percent or more of american dont know that thei know someon who gai for that seventi percent or more their attitud ar realli base on gai peopl as a symbol gai peopl ar thi sort of abstract on dimension concept that theyv been taught about in variou wai as be someth that symbol sin or symbol immor symbol sexual promiscu symbol simpli the peopl who arent accept in our societi and for that reason thei hold neg attitud toward gai peopl not base on their person experi presid clinton ha ask for a draft execut order that would lift the ban on gai in the militari by thi summer by juli if he sign that then the militari presum would be charg with try to chang these attitud how can that be done these ar attitud that peopl grow up with thei ar attitud that peopl grow up with but theyr not impervi to chang you know the militari ha an excel record of chang attitud chang prejudic when thei set their mind to it and the exampl im think of is their experi with chang racial attitud and when thei did it thei were incred success certainli there still racism within the militari but i think that of the institut we have in our societi there is much less racial intoler than there is in other institut and i think that if the militari take those same lesson the lesson that thei learn in fight racism and appli them to fight prejudic against lesbian and gai men thei can be success you know psycholog speak although there

michael she exercis her judgment she told them she did not have a zoe baird problem she didnt have a zoe baird problem she act at all time lawfulli she did all the file all the disclosur paid all the

shouldnt be blame for not have tri to read between the line of what thei were try to find out oh come on you mean to sai when thei said to her do you have a zoe baird problem it never cross her mind to mention the fact that shed hire an illeg alien even though for technic reason it wa legal well it wa legal and it alwai ha been legal and if thei had polit consider that thei were take into account then thei should have articul them im more concern about the fact that ron brown ha paid hi social secur tax late and thi is someth that perhap wa not legal for him to do at the time that he fail to

washington who wa on the short list for attornei gener got bounc caus he had a social secur problem he a man i dont see how you can argu there a doubl standard well there is a doubl standard becaus the first victim were women and the peopl most like to be hurt by all of thi ar women there ar singl parent million of them in thi countri who ar try to be creativ everydai try to figur out how theyr go to take care of their children and that by the wai is becaus of twelv year of absolut neglect of the child care crisi by the reagan and the bush administr and i think the govern ha put women in thi posit and there is go to be a veri definit impact on women what ar we go to be look for now onli women who have live in <unk> wait a second ms allr let me just ask you a question isnt it the case that zoe baird wa the on who rais thi nobodi went to her and said zoe what about your child care situat she volunt thi inform understand that it could compromis her as the lead offici of justic in the unit state and said if thi is a problem let me know well the white hous essenti sai no big deal it o k with us peopl in the hous and the senat said no big deal but it turn out the american peopl said it wa a big deal why would you blame presid clinton for that i dont blame presid clinton but i do ask for leadership by presid clinton we heard of stand by your man well id like him to stand by hi woman wait a minut id like kimba wood to be the next attornei gener wait a minut i just want to clarifi thi gloria gloria you do agre with me that the doubl standard is peopl who happen to be confirm zoe baird versu peopl who happen to be confirm after her irrespect of their sex and men and women of both sex that about cover it have both been caught almost everybodi theyr caught in the gear afterward and got awai with it beforehand so it mai be a doubl standard but it ha noth to do with sexual discrimin kimba wood wasnt get awai with anyth the judg show the highest ethic standard by compli with all law and she tri to pull a fast on of the presid of the unit state you refus to admit that well i think the fast on is perhap the ration afterward for why her name is no longer there and up for nomin as attornei gener o k and i just think that it unfair to victim her twice first by forc her to withdraw and second by attack her and somehow sai that she had the burden of come forth with thi she had the burden of answer a question give inform that she knew darn well thei want and she purpos didnt bring it forth all right let me ask juan a question juan youv made the point that zoe baird came forward and indic she had a problem she did the right thing why didnt ron brown do that i dont think anybodi ask him it wasnt on the tabl but you just said that zoe baird came forth and did it zoe baird and admit shed done someth wrong that right and thi gui a seven hundr fifti thousand dollar a year big time lawyer didnt pai ani of the social secur tax for hi help zoe baird come forward and tell the truth she out kimba wood didnt do anyth she out ron brown cover up he stai in the cabinet how do you explain that to the women of america that there no doubl standard there no cover up here at most you can sai there a sin of omiss why didnt ron brown volunt thi inform mayb ron brown at the time wasnt awar that he had broken the law mayb ron brown consid in the wai that zoe baird and the wai that other peopl in thi town you know would you accept that for you know if ed mees said i wasnt awar that wa the law id sai mr mees youd make a dead run to the washington post and youd be write all night you got it and id also expect that mr mees would make up for it in just the wai that ron brown ha done and that both these men had been confirm befor the issu wa rais you seem to want to ignor that gloria doesnt it make you slightli sick to hear pat buchanan come on here as the great defend of women and dont you feel that by rais thi fuss you ar give aid and comfort to peopl like pat as oppos to bill clinton who clearli knock himself out to find women for hi cabinet and ha done a heck of a lot better than pat boss or ani presid that ever came befor him well it doe make me slightli queasi to be on the same side as pat buchanan but as thei sai polit make strang bedfellow and it couldnt be stranger in thi case but i will sai that we do have to hold the clinton and the administr as much as i support them and i do to the highest standard and we need to educ the american public that thi is not the same situat with kimba wood where she did compli with all the law kimba wood did compli with all the law and zoe baird did not by the wai what about the complet self righteous and the moral hypocrisi in washington i think if your go to ask these question of cabinet appointe each and everi senat each and everi member of congress ought to answer those question themselv as to whether theyv ever hire anyon who wa undocu whether theyv paid all the social secur tax worker comp and all the rest of it and ill bet the answer by mani of them would be number o k gloria well state how seriou is the polit mess in which the clinton white hous find itself that issu just as soon as we come back welcom back becaus she fail to level with the white hous about have hire an illeg alien as a babysitt seven year ago judg kimba wood will not be attornei gener of the unit state kimba wood did not jump she wa push overboard by the clinton white hous did the white hous do the right thing and why cant them seem to get it right our guest in california feminist attornei gloria allr and here in washington journalist juan william of the washington post and sometim co host of crossfir juan we have had a real debacl with the zoe baird thing and now the kimba wood thing and the mess over attornei gener isnt thi the inevit result when you try to make the unit state depart of justic a gender set asid for feminist well i think if you want to look at it in term of the bean count critic i guess you could make that comment but youv also got to understand that if you want to bean count all weve had over there ar white male pat and what your sai here is on the clinton part were try to open up thi process were go to look and see if there ar qualifi women and there ar qualifi women avail for that posit but juan william look what mr clinton ha said in effect is that if your a white male lawyer you need not appli for my depart of justic now if anyon had said excus me that we dont want ani women applic for justic and no black applic for justic you would go bonker your right o k but why is it o k to sai that all the men who ar judg white male all the men who ar lawyer all the men who ar head up law depart at variou univers thei ar unqualifi thei ar out of consider why is that right well your wrong on two point on is no on said that there ar not qualifi applic not desir thei can appli in fact jerri <unk> chuck <unk> other peopl have certainli appli and been consid the big point here is that our histori as american indic that we have had discrimin against women against black against hispan asian and that the clinton peopl ar veri interest in make sure that everyon is consid for these appoint theyr not consid everyon theyr rule out white male no theyr simpli sai that we have well you do when you sai theyr rule out men when you sai that my attornei gener is go to be a woman that tend as michael point out to rule out that other sex which is male number ar you tell me chuck <unk> a woman or jerri <unk> is a woman no these ar peopl who ar be consid for the job even as we sit here thei would have listen look the governor former <unk> is a former governor of virginia if thei werent after a woman he would be attornei gener right now why isnt he what wrong well im certainli not go to ask gloria allr what wrong with look for a woman let me put it the other wai to you gloria onc again you see how your fall right into pat trap here clinton said i dont think he ever said i insist on have a woman what he said is im go to be more imagin and more energet in seek a divers cabinet and he did that that take risk with it you tend to go to name that ar not as well known as other name and you end up with some setback as he had would you blame him if at thi point he said i am go to go for the most prestigi judg or law school dean i can find and if that a man so be it absolut weve got to have a woman as attornei gener look thi ha been a men club in the depart of justic from the begin of time it time to break through the glass ceil in govern govern is the largest employ in the nation it set the moral tone and presid clinton ha got to show leadership and have a woman in there we cant have onli three women in the cabinet out of fourteen posit that what presid bush had weve got to do better than that and we have to have at least on more and that in the depart of justic you know but ms allr the idea that the onli woman that can be in the white hous as a lawyer is the wife of the presid is complet unaccept thi is nineteen nineti three we need an attornei gener who a woman you know what interest here ms allr is that in fact when you look at zoe <unk> record or when you come forward and look at kimba wood record you see that in fact theyr pretti conserv in mani of the posit theyv taken you know i dont think there ani doubt about zoe baird at aetna and the kind of posit she wa take anti litig and so forth along dan quayl line and when you look at the fact that bush appoint kimba wood to the feder judiciari i think that in fact you need women who have more liber credenti dont you well i like that there ar plenti of feminist women lawyer and women judg out there there the nation women judg associ we have hundr of name we could provid anytim from the nation women polit caucu we have provid name let me ask you gloria the question that pat cant ask you caus of our format tonight if you had a choic between someon who agre with your view about legal issu and happen to be a man or someon who disagre with them and happen to be a woman would you realli pick the woman those ar fals altern becaus i want a woman with feminist view you want your cake and eat it too who believ in <unk> with a record of civil right and consum right and there ar mani women out there who will fit that descript and that doesnt have a nanni problem let me get to you juan on the thi is the larger thing republican havent realli gone after bill clinton he is stumbl all over the lot i mean is thi just as casei <unk> cant anybodi here plai thi game is thi just a coupl of mistak or is thi endem in thi administr it in troubl well theyr in troubl theyr have a littl troubl come out of the box but i think that it quick to condemn anybodi i mean im not condemn them theyr theyr just here i mean theyr just get set theyr just try to get their staf theyr try to get the phone to work it is everi i mean these arent thi isnt pat buchanan conserv journalist ar sai it the worst start up of ani administr thei can ever recal what is the problem and what did thei sai when reagan wa start and what did thei sai when bush wa start if thei alwai sai it it the same old cant were in the same town it like tribal rite my good and onc again gloria arent you give aid and comfort to the peopl who ar sai these sort of thing by rais a fuss over clinton when the blame realli goe in thi last i mean i agre with the zoe baird thing he blew it he made a mistak of judgment but i cannot see what he did wrong in thi kimba wood thing when she kept the crucial fact secret from him no i mean women have been told to keep silent for mani year for two hundr year at least oh wait now there a war oh wait now there an econom problem just be silent and final someon will address our concern later when it more conveni when there a better time no thi is a time we have to address it as we go along and i know that presid and hillari clinton will do their best to have a feminist woman as attornei gener but weve got to also realli have a strict scrutini of what thei ar do and the process as we go all right let take a break and when we come back were go to talk about anoth littl corner of thi kimba wood busi the playboi bunni scandal gloria allr somehow it leak out dure thi mess last week that kimba wood thirti year ago had spent a few dai train to work in a playboi club in london now i dont find that in ani wai a bad thing about kimba wood i dont think you do juan doesnt ill bet even pat buchanan doesnt so why ar peopl try to make such a big deal out of that well i think that perhap some peopl suspect the presid motiv that thei think that mayb thi wa the real flap that he wa concern about and didnt want to be subject to joke on late night talk show about have a playboi bunni <unk> or mayb that doesnt even make sens a <unk> as the attornei gener of the unit state mayb that wa the real reason i dont know most peopl i know seem unlik doesnt it dont even care if she becam a playboi bunni which she never did but you know why the point is that thi obvious wa leak out by the clinton peopl in the white hous and look what she did twenti three year old work as whether it wa a <unk> in a playboi bunni club is go to be good for a laugh for on night at the talk show host but nobodi wa go to withhold approv her on that ground of cours not so what is the accus against the clinton peopl the clinton peopl leak it out nobodi knew that isnt that right yeah the clinton peopl let it out but that the point is here the clinton peopl were sai here the entir record thi woman had not been fulli truth with us about the zoe baird problem were put it all out in term of thing that weigh against her in our mind you know what i think thei were defend a decis thei knew wa inher <unk> and mayb even cowardli to dump the woman what ar you talk about thei dump her and then thei want to defend themselv we had a lot of troubl oh come on pat thei dump her sure thei did she eventu came forward with inform thei were unawar of and put them in a compromis posit and thei panick and dump her thei could have got her through all right well get to that at the end pat i want to come back to that but last question to gloria arent thing that clinton ha alreadi done as presid like lift the abort gag rule and push through that famili leav bill far more import for women than thi littl fuss over kimba wood well i think it veri signific all of the abort right legisl that he sign and order and all of the famili leav bill which weve struggl so long to get into law and of cours there ar mani challeng ahead but it still veri import that women be in the palac of power in the white hous that we have an opportun to particip in import decis that affect women live becaus our daughter need role model we need women as leader and there is no substitut for women in the white hous iv got to cut you off at that point thank you gloria allr out in l a thank you juan william here in washington your welcom ill explain the fact of life to pat in just a moment rememb on more week of pat and then john sununu is back for a while meanwhil pat you call clinton decis to dump kimba wood which he obvious did cowardli would presid buchanan how would presid buchanan react if a cabinet nomine had withheld obvious on purpos inform that she knew perfectli well wa relev to hi decis well she and then found out about it at the last minut she brought in all these document and thing id take a look at my council and id make a judgment i would not i think it wa a cowardli i think thei choke michael but you would have pat your such a hypocrit you would have been livid at thi women for stab you in the back and deni you thi she didnt it wasnt stab in the back you know he ask her do you have a zoe baird problem and she us a lot of <unk> to get out of answer that question straight michael theyr in troubl becaus of thi idiot polici of make the justic

and michael <unk> cooper attornei for the center for constitut right good even welcom to crossfir sinc nineteen eighti seven the unit state ha ban peopl infect with the aid viru from enter the countri no other advanc countri in the world ha such a ban except south africa dure the bush administr the depart of health and human servic favor lift the ban sai it wa medic unjustifi but the justic depart block ani chang now the clinton administr is commit to lift that ban possibl soon critic sai lift the ban will promot the spread of thi fatal diseas thei also sai that let in peopl with aid will be a costli burden on american health care why thei ask should america take that risk and undertak that cost that the crossfir pat mr <unk> at the same time were try to contain thi fatal diseas why would you introduc into the u s new sourc of infect the fact of the matter is peopl come into the unit state everi singl dai infect with the aid viru i know that you might prefer to have peopl test for the aid viru at the airport but as it stand peopl have come in with aid ar alwai go to be come in with aid as long as we have the diseas what we need to do is listen to the public health offici not the politician when it come to how we ought to deal with the aid viru mr <unk> i think what you ought to do is you ought to try answer the question the question is when you have an epidem of a danger deadli diseas when we ar told we ar all at risk why would you knowingli bring into the unit state hundr and hundr of peopl who ar carrier of thi infect and who could pass it on and kill american citizen you just show you dont understand the fact when you sai were all at risk i dont feel im at risk im marri and i dont us drug i dont know whether your at risk the point is thi peopl have been come in with aid as long as there ha been the viru peopl will why would you increas the number we arent increas the number sure you ar your go to let them in even if you know it it the same you know what thei come in anywai and let me explain to you how most peopl who come into the unit state ar non immigr thei ar not test for aid peopl can i know that mr <unk> six hundr peopl last year with aid were stop and not allow into the countri let assum half ar activ homosexu three hundr peopl thei have ten contact a year that three thousand occas in on year when those peopl could pass the diseas on that quit an assumpt quit assumpt well i mean if you read the statist that quit low quit an assumpt six hundr out of a million immigr how mani immigr did we have last year congressman a million we had a million immigr but as pat just said we dont know how mani peopl ar come into thi countri with aid the problem is that the individu with the aid viru constitut a threat to public health and a drain on the public treasuri well congressman wait a minut it a threat to the public health becaus everybodi admit thi is a diseas that is seriou that can be spread that continu to be spread it a drain on the public treasuri becaus these individu cost on hundr dollar to two hundr thousand dollar each to treat all right i think youv rais the two issu let put the public treasuri issu asid no no just for a second well get back to it and take the public health issu o k now the american medic associ came out todai flatli in favor of lift the ban thei said there no sound scientif public health basi for thi <unk> now do you know someth the a m a doesnt know ye i do and i know someth that the american peopl know as well and it call common sens for them to sai that we cannot exclud peopl with aid thei have to certifi as the presid ha to certifi that it is not a <unk> diseas with public health signific there is i dont know of a singl american who is go to sai that look do you know can you name me it

politician well we have lot of doctor theyr all public health expert the onli peopl in favor of the ban ar those that ar hyster about aid in gener and politician who ar try to make a lot of cheap point on no no let me agre with him on on thing i do think there a lot of propaganda and hysteria about aid i dont realli believ were all at risk but there no doubt thi is the truth let take tuberculosi it is becom epidem in new york and other area so is hepat the major <unk> of tuberculosi ar peopl who get aid and therefor becom vulner to all these diseas and carri them and spread them contagi as well as infecti why would you add last year thei kept out six hundr peopl with aid why would you even add six hundr more peopl who ar go to be carrier of the aid viru as well as countless other diseas if thei stai perman in the unit state why do it let me give you on reason how doe it help our countri you ask and let me give you an answer i repres a woman who a u s citizen and her son

about immigr right now im talk about immigr most of them ar either here or theyr come here to join famili member if you want to protect your countri from aid and i think we would all agre why would you not send them back if thei mani of them as you know if not most of them got the diseas on wai and it the same wai thei can transmit it thei ar carrier and transmitt of the most but your assum theyr go to transmit it your assum that these six hundr peopl who have been told thei have aid and know theyr go to die ar go to go and sai how do you think thei got it you cant lock them up the last thing that on their mind im sure unless you have some psychopath with aid is go out and infect other peopl how do you think theyv been get it fellow you got a million of them how ar you go to prevent it from happen ar you go to lock these peopl up how ar you go to prevent them from continu to spread aid let me ask you what ar you go to do about mr <unk> client the woman whose son is dy of aid want to come and die in thi countri with hi mother well under current law as mike know under current law if your a close famili member where your come for a short term as a visitor you can come into the unit state were not talk about those individu were talk about individu who ar come in as immigr so your go to let thi gui in who dont have ani famili member for how long for these few peopl humanitarian reason i would let them in that how mani there probabl six hundr of those number there not that what it is that who most of them ar you know what i find interest you gui ar conserv here thei can come in alreadi hold on your the conserv right and conserv ar oppos to unnecessari govern regul and not spend monei when we dont have to and your and your the what your suggest is is that we spend a lot of monei unnecessarili on thi issu were also in favor of public health and and your for constitut right and on of them is the right to life when we come back will bill clinton open america door to the hundr of thousand of haitian who ar there in haiti and who ar begin to knock welcom back were debat the impend decis of presid clinton to allow h i v posit immigr into the unit state the clinton <unk> sai it is in our <unk> tradit republican sai the liber have lost their mind our guest republican lamar smith of texa who is on the immigr subcommitte and michael <unk> is an attornei with the center for constitut right let talk about the cost now if we mai of folk and were talk now about individu immigr who come into thi countri who we know ar h i v posit or have full blown aid why should the american taxpay who have to take care of their own nation famili be have thi burden impos upon them of on hundr dollar to two hundr thousand dollar per aid patient who come into the countri when theyr have a terribl time take care of our own peopl gener thei dont and let me explain why first of all to administ the current law the on that go to be chang probabl cost more just in pure administr than it would to care for the six hundr peopl whove come in with aid second who havent come in well who havent come in aid exactli how could it cost more than on hundr thousand dollar a person for administr cost no you have to administ the cost for all the peopl you test not just the on who turn out to have aid exactli and process all the paper of immigr immigr ha a billion dollar budget right now congressman let me explain there a million peopl in the unit state right now with the viru on million peopl you know what the cost of that is on hundr billion dollar plu now ar we sai the american taxpay can afford to pai that and more no what he sai congressman is that the cost of <unk> thi law is more than the cost of treat the peopl who would get in if you didnt have thi silli law and there on other thing the congressman i dont see how it could be possibl on other thing you have to keep in mind congressman a law that you folk made on capitol hill sai that person cant immigr to the unit state or thei cant even come as visitor or student if theyr like to becom a public charg i wa hope youd bring that up you know why i wa hope youd bring that up mike why becaus you probabl know as i know you know how mani peopl were exclud becaus of the danger that thei might becom a public charg in nineteen nineti the last year for which we have figur zero <unk> none not true no peopl were exclud becaus of not true and the year befor that there were three peopl congressman you want me to have their famili member i just check thi start call your offic tomorrow you know why that is let talk about i dont know where your check you have some person experi of cours i do no the law is meaningless peopl get turn down everi singl dai for visa for like to becom a public charg and i will be happi to get your phone number and have their famili member call you your go to have to do that afterward let talk about haitian immigr mr clinton himself ha back down befor hi inaugur when the great boat lift wa about to begin with ten of thousand mayb hundr of thousand of haitian immigr pour into florida do you think we should open our door to that boat lift from haiti if it involv ten of thousand and hundr of thousand of haitian i think that we have to begin abid by intern law in how we treat the haitian refuge by that i mean peopl have to be given an opportun to appli for asylum and show whether or not theyr refuge it not a question of open our door we have a histori mr <unk> we have a histori in the caribbean of open our door to refuge from cuba the onli differ i realli see between the cuban and the haitian is skin color and possibl ideolog well let me explain to you what the differ first twenti percent of the cuban ar black who ar refuge secondli thei ar shot in the florida strait if theyr caught third if the haitian immigr ar polit refuge in fear of their life thei can pick up and walk next door into the dominican republ thei dont got to get on a boat and go five hundr mile to the unit state you just said you want to send a bunch of them with aid back to haiti with some balonei about tell the polic not to shoot them i said no listen the unit state ha got enough listen i think we ought to lift the embargo on haiti and not destroi the economi of that littl countri all right were get far afield let get back to aid for a second you know congressman thi notion that the unit state would be flood with peopl with aid look for free treatment if we lift thi ban is sort of hilari becaus the unit state is the onli major countri in the world that doesnt suppli guarante health care for everyon why wouldnt these peopl from the third world go to franc go to germani mike you know as well as i know that the unit state ha a reput for provid the best health care possibl thei also know that the american taxpay will pick up the tab have you ever all thei have to do is go into a hospit ask a foreign what thei think about american health care if you go to a hospit todai you check with ani physician you know and you come in and you ar test and you ar found to have aid or have the aid viru you ar declar an emerg and the taxpay pick up the tab that why those individu want to come to america let me try onc more why would thei come to america and not to germani or franc where there no problem at all no controversi at all and everyon is know to guarante health care to everyon mike for all i know thei mai want to go to those countri too all we know is we have million of peopl who ar try to get into the unit state we happen to be a mecca for most of the peopl in the world but million of peopl cant get into the unit state irrespect of whether we have thi ban or not that just a fantasi of your but more ar go to be encourag if we have a polici that sai were go to let you in how do these other countri manag mr <unk> let get back to where i think you probabl will agre which is let get back to tuberculosi and we all agre peopl that tuberculosi becaus that contagi as well as infecti that remain that remain on the list but the reason that tuberculosi is spread and hepat ar spread is becaus aid patient becaus their immun system is collaps becom victim by these diseas thei contain them keep them thei cant get rid of them and so thei spread them so in a sens ar you even invit a spread of the tuberculosi epidem if you allow voluntarili peopl you know who have aid in the unit state the number ar so insignific you talk about six hundr out of a million immigr and out of hundr well michael kinslei wa talk the other night if just on life were lost in a car wreck then it cost five hundr million dollar to g m all the monei that would be involv what ar you talk about im talk about what you were talk about the other night the tradeoff of cost for live i said of cours there a tradeoff of cost for live all right how much for these live of peopl dy of tuberculosi and aid and the diseas be spread in the unit state pat you know we have more aid in thi countri than ani other countri in the world we ar export aid the idea that were try to protect ourselv from foreign with infect is insan mike mai i ask you a question o k in order for us to chang the polici mr clinton ha to sai that aid is not a <unk> diseas of signific health import do you agre with that do you think most american sai aid is not the doctor sai so the doctor sai so a <unk> diseas of signific health import it is not <unk> in the sens that tuberculosi is well then why ar worri about the spread of it throughout the unit state why ar we have spend all thi monei why ar we have a drug czar it not <unk> in the sens that tuberculosi is and everi public health offici agre well not in the same sens but it not contagi it infecti let take a break when we come back were go to we talk about haitian were go to talk a littl about cuban congressman smith your concern about the cost of treat peopl with aid who come into thi countri as immigr if thi rule is lift a million peopl come into thi countri everi year sure at least six hundr of them must have seriou case of cancer which is equal costli to treat should thei be kept out too mike im glad you brought that up becaus it interest to me how much we spend on research for aid compar to individu with cancer that interest but how about answer my question no no ill answer your question we spend five time as much on aid as we do for cancer and fifti four time as much on aid as heart diseas great now answer my question o k now why is it what wa your question why should you be so hyster about the cost of treat peopl who come with aid when im not hyster well let me ask you should we ban peopl who want to come into thi countri who have cancer know that the medic treatment might be veri expens the cancer cost and the heart diseas cost ar not near what thei ar with aid nor ar thei spread the same wai not true the other oh come on why dont you just sai that your hung up on aid no no the other point is i think someon should speak up for the american taxpay who is pai on hundr dollar to two hundr thousand dollar per individu and im sai why dont you speak up for the american taxpay in the case of cancer and the other point ha to go with the procedur itself thi the aid wa put on the list to keep immigr out in nineteen eighti seven by act of congress why shouldnt we have a full and open debat in congress to take it off the list why should mr clinton get awai with it on thi unilater decis congressman i just sai that i find it veri interest that you and mr buchanan ar so concern about public health ar you in favor of univers health care i mean your concern these gui ar concern about public health all of a sudden im in favor of keep infecti and contagi diseas awai from the public and if you ar not go right ahead and sai so in the camera i said that i am too but the fact of the matter is of the six hundr peopl that have it i mean our client that have it for exampl ar the woman that got it at georgetown univers hospit in heart surgeri all im sai mr <unk> befor she got her green card and her u s citizen kid ha it too let sai it is should we keep her out when she got it in surgeri at georgetown look if you got six hundr that anoth good on if youv got six hundr peopl here she got it here in an oper mani of them mr <unk> if you got six hundr peopl let sai half of them ar gai activist oh come on pleas well how do you think thei get the diseas thei dont all get it from transfus more than half of those who die ar gai activist theyr activist thei still ar theyr not onli gai theyr activist theyr activ gai mike you cant theyr activ gai i see that right you cant sai your concern about the public health in not let these individu in when in fact thei ar go to transmit the diseas when thei get here you cant lock them theyr go to what do you mean theyr go to how do you sai theyr go to transmit it you know theyr all right these two gui will argu off the show and well argu on the show in just a minut thank you congress smith thank you mr <unk> my pleasur well be back thi is your last remind john sununu return on mondai but pat wont be go far and hell be

who becam a christian after never realli be religi she felt that her success career wa jut not enough nineteen year old gretchen <unk> wa rais with no religion at all a year ago she convert to catholic and marc and beth fireston were rais in jewish home but were not observ todai thei ar practic orthodox judaism and join me here in new york to help explain all of thi rabbi harold <unk> who author of the bestsel when bad thing happen to good peopl and ill talk to him in just a littl bit also with me sociologist wade clark roof professor of religion and sociolog and societi at the univers of california at santa barbara he the author of a gener of seeker the spiritu journei of the babi boom gener welcom to all of you mr roof the scope of what were talk about i mean is thi realli a reviv or ar we see bit and piec patch of peopl come back well sonya thi is a massiv transform in the religi landscap were see larg number of peopl either return to religi institut after mani year of be laps or theyr ask fundament spiritu question about their own live so i would character thi as certainli a massiv transform the word reviv is load with all sort of religi connot and perhap were a bit too close to us that term but certainli it a major set of chang give me a sens of number those who mai have drop out complet versu those who just pull back a littl bit those who have come back complet in an orthodox sens to those who ar seek a sens of spiritu but not necessarili tradit religion well we found in our work that about on third of the <unk> gener had been loyalist thei were there when thei were grow up and theyr still there that mean two third of them drop out of religi particip in the year when thei were grow up now mani of those peopl ar now return so what weve got ar roughli forti percent of those peopl who drop out our studi show ar now return or at least explor the possibl of find a religi home about ten percent an addit ten percent i describ as intens seeker theyd look for all kind of new wai of believ and of mix and match their belief on their own term thei push the boundari out as far as possibl theyr not interest in religi institut so much as thei ar in their own person quest then perhap the largest group ar peopl who i character as believ but not <unk> these ar peopl who sai thei believ in god thei would have their child baptiz thei would certainli want a church or a templ for a wed or a funer but thei ar not interest in particip in organ religion mani of those peopl seem to be increasingli spiritu as well so it a fascin mix of differ style and if there on thing that boomer gener peopl like it the choic of style now what do you think it is that theyr realli look for ar thei look for some principl to live their live by a common set of valu ar thei look for a god that ha a master plan a sens of order so that thei can feel that there realli is someth that is <unk> in the world i think mani of them ar look for some kind of anchor for their live thei have experienc a great deal of mobil in the past twenti twenti five year theyv move awai from home often awai from the gener area in which thei grew up mani of them ar express a good deal of empti with their live and their career and perhap their marriag and now thei a lack of structur a lack of order lack of sens of purpos and mean and mani now would like to find someth that you realli could depend upon in a world in which there so much chao and mr roof weve seen so mani peopl take kind of the latest fashion ar we go to see religion du jour i mean is thi kind of a transit thing or do you realli believ that thi is a back to the root sens of know i need a center and it ha to be connect to someth larger than myself and my pocketbook there alwai some <unk> and fashion associ with religi trend as in other trend but i realli do believ that what happen now is some kind of fundament quest to find some stabl valu and commit and i think for thi gener theyll never be quit the same again as a result of the experi theyr now go through rais their children or with a quest about their own live that theyr in have said that will thei live differ well that a difficult question will thei live differ often there a big discrep between peopl valu and belief and how thei live i suspect that mani ar go to be touch for the rest of their live by these quest some will live differ thei will becom more religi observ or particip in religi commun other will simpli continu their quest and i suspect it will be a lifetim quest for mani of them well youv done a wonder job describ them now of cours let have an opportun to meet them after all who ar these new or these real <unk> believ and what is it that theyr seek ill talk with some folk who feel that thei have found a home in old time religion when sonya live continu when it come to religion some of them ar complet drop out a few have never left but a grow number of the babi boomer appear to be return to their church and their synagogu and to a new spiritu awaken or at least to a new sens of structur and place marc and beth fireston took class in basic judaism when thei were date both were rais in non observ jewish home but now thei ar practic orthodox jew welcom to both of you thank you veri much marc why do you think you went to what might be consid the most or the least updat the most tradit of the choic within judaism that you might have had i think you know the ag of natur food is here and i felt if i wa go to look toward judaism look back to my own backyard which i realli hadnt look at for most of my life i want the <unk> form of the clearest commun i thought from our ancestor from our teacher from our rabbi as what exactli judaism wa about have said that beth is it that is it that you dont have to make a lot of choic it kind of laid out for you you know exactli what right and what wrong i think i have to make more choic now than i realli ever had to make i dont think it that so much your alwai given free choic all the wai along but in a time when there so mani choic it nice to know that our tradit at the jewish bibl <unk> the wai to do busi the wai to enjoi a relationship the wai to have love in marriag et cetera so that were given direct that interest and that is of cours the idea the idea of be given direct as we heard befor with us is rabbi harold <unk> who join me hi latest book is call to life a celebr of jewish be and think i seem to rememb from mr <unk> book that the group that drop off the most were jewish youngster jewish boomer and from hi studi im not sure how mani ar go back but when thei do go back do thei tend to go back to orthodoxi and if so why well ye and no sonya first of all it veri hard to appli gener standard to what happen in judaism for a coupl of reason on were such a small peopl that the impact of inter marriag <unk> is much greater on the jewish commun becaus nineti five percent of the peopl out there in the world ar <unk> at least in the american world beyond that judaism doesnt realli happen in the synagogu as much as it happen in a home and so if peopl stop go to synagogu but had some sort of jewish ident jewish affirm in the home thei mai strike their rabbi as have drop out then thei strike the sociologist of have drop out but theyr still be veri jewish when thei go back do thei go back to the tradit as the <unk> did a lot of them do becaus theyr look for authent theyr look for more serious than thei find in the liber church and synagogu includ my own but i think on of the thing theyr do it repres a reject of the <unk> of so much of american life we had a famili in my congreg in massachusett who move to new york for busi reason came back a year later for a celebr the wife told me that thei had move to brooklyn and join an orthodox synagogu i said to her joan how could you do that you were a feminist how can you prai in a synagogu where thei make you sit behind a curtain and she said becaus in the orthodox world my best friend husband wont make a pass at me men wont tell off color joke to embarrass me my children wont get caught up in drug and promiscu in school im will to make certain sacrific to escap from some of the pitfal of the secular american life i think thi is what attract a lot of peopl to a more seriou religion im go to get back to that you have realli open up a veri interest chapter for us to discuss in that area but let me greet gretchen <unk> who is with us now a colleg student a member of the campu ministri at cathol univers what influenc your decis to convert to catholic well as i wa grow up basic in high school i felt that i wa miss someth i wa o k with my friend my famili my school work wa go well but i felt that there wa someth miss i didnt feel whole and so as a result i start search try to find someth that would make me feel whole and my junior year i met a friend who start take me to cathol mass and thei just realli seem to fit in with my style i like the ritual as you were mention earlier i like the fact that a lot of it wa laid out and what about what the rabbi just said you know in a wai that there ar certain rule and regul and expect behavior and a wai of realli sai thi is my belief as oppos to attempt to find a reason why you cant do someth that someon is try to push you to do right that not so much of an issu with me it doe give me a boundari to sai thi is why im do what i do and in that respect it help let bring in someon els who ha a point of view on thi pat <unk> is with us now it interest to note pat you ran your own public relat firm and you were never realli religi now your a protest fundamentalist and i want to know how you balanc the real world of busi which we all see out there and might be call vulgar as the rabbi suggest and your own veri deep fundamentalist belief well it a veri interest process i dont see it as that hard although it take a counter intuit approach to busi well give me an illustr i mean obvious i would expect that with a convers you see the world a littl differ absolut so how is that i basic came to understand that i had been fill my life with what i would call idl that i wa <unk> work or the next account wa go to make me happi or the next car or the next thing wa go to make me happi and as i went through thi process i began to realiz that the next anyth wa not what wa go to make me happi and i realiz that <unk> sai that we walk around within us with a god shape vacuum and we try to fill it with other thing and noth els will hold it becaus it is man well there ha to mean though that there ar deal you wont take peopl you will not have anyth to do with rule that you will stand up and sai im sorri but that is outsid of my busi acumen in term of my philosophi of life exactli exactli and so you walk awai from it absolut you must but it doesnt feel like a sacrific in a sens that your realli sai thi is you know im meant to do thing the right wai and you trust it and tell the truth and what i found in busi is my busi is actual do much better as a consequ rather than try to appli my own worldli wisdom to it i turn to a wai of approach that is base in how god want us to behav mr roof i find thi so interest becaus on would hope that when we profess to be christian or jew and we have a valu that we live by those valu as oppos to alwai have those valu for other as you were go around and interview the folk in your book did thei chang their live in meaning wai as pat is describ ye we found a lot of evid of that and i think pat exampl fit veri nice with what we discov she us the word <unk> of her life and i think a lot of that is go on now as peopl discov that mani of the materi quest that thei dream of have when thei were younger a larg portion of thi popul ha scale down their materi expect and out of that ha come a <unk> of what realli ar the major valu after all that life ought to be focus around and i think i heard that in her statement and iv heard that with mani of the peopl we interview you know what i think is on of the thing go on wade is that the gener you wrote your book about is probabl the first gener that cannot count on be more success than their parent in materi term and i think what your see them do is redefin success in more person spiritu term im hear a lot of young peopl sai i mai not make as much monei as my father did i mai not rais my kid in as nice a hous as i grew up in but im go to have my head on straight im not go to bring my work home weekend im go to be abl to take time off to see my kid in school plai theyr redefin how thei understand what it mean to be success in wai that leav much more room for the spiritu the religi the commun compon when we continu id like to ask about that two thing the rabbi ha said on ha to do with the issu of spiritu and i think that there ar peopl who ar seeker in try to find piec of religion that suit themselv best i need to get back to that and also if your a feminist if you fought so hard to get to a place of equal ar you go to go behind the curtain in a new fundamentalist form of religi reviv well ask that question too two on two six four three zero zero seven seven join us their parent sent them to sundai school religi class the church or synagogu wa a big part of their grow up then mani of them turn awai the babi boomer of the sixti and seventi todai have their own children and find themselv look for guess what religion why the chang of heart find out as sonya live continu and im talk about a kind of religi reviv why ar some peopl go back to religion and other find it for the first time jai and ginger <unk> ar member of a baptist church in atlanta both went through divorc and period of unsur faith ginger what brought you to the point of <unk> yourself to the church well basic sonya i realiz that through my life as an adult in my twenti that i wa alwai search in the materi sens as we discuss earlier in that your alwai out there look for approv from other in differ area whether it danc or drink or just carri on total opposit from the wai that i wa brought up in a christian home and i realiz that i just realli got tire of wonder what i should do next got tire of think that if what im do is right or wrong no direct no secur no peac of mind and my sister and i had been talk and we share that the most secur most peac time in our live wa the time that we were in church that everyth wa in order we knew where we were go et cetera so i had just gone through a seri of event and i had realiz that it wa mother dai nineteen nineti actual i just woke up on morn and i said im tire of it im sick and tire of try to figur out how i should live my life it doe simplifi thing mr <unk> it doe simplifi thing i mean i dont think there ani question jai let me ask you if you go back to the church as it wa if you ask the church to accommod your a minist so your both someon who is a believ clearli and who can lead other doe the church make adjust for you when you ask the question about a minist im sorri i didnt quit understand that sonya i want to know if the church accommod do you ask the church to accommod your new self someon who divorc perhap in a church that might not have recogn that someon who mai have fallen from belief and come back ar there accommod on both side i dont person feel that it is ask the church to accommod me i think the church is veri accept of whatev point you ar in your life if your divorc i think that there a place in the church for you and if you have a beaver cleaver type famili there a place for you also and i think on of the thing that im see in the church todai is that theyr understand that theyv got to reach all spectrum of peopl not just the on that have the perfect famili but the peopl that theyr in situat just like ginger and i right let take a call if we mai as we go to shelli in new york hi shelli hi i wa brought up an orthodox jew in connecticut and my husband wa brought up as a roman cathol when we left our home to becom adult we both reject the teach that were what we consid forc upon us and the restrict and the <unk> we were marri by a unitarian <unk> minist and we have found that belong to thi type of a liber religi faith that we do have someth to live by that thi religion doe promot the inher worth of everi person regardless of their religi background and we found that the religion we were brought up in did not affirm that im wonder if rabbi <unk> could comment let go to rabbi <unk> for that ye what i admir about your solut is that you share a faith with your husband with your children and the famili i think the solut for peopl from differ religi background who fall in love and want to get marri is rather than each on go their separ wai and rais children who ar half jewish and half christian in which case the question aris which half is jewish and which half is christian you come to some meet of the mind whether it a third faith that neither of you wa rais in whether the on with the stronger <unk> pull attract the other so that the christian wife convert to judaism the jewish husband convert to christian so that religion is someth you have in common rather than someth you share becaus you see it not theologi it ident and commun it who do you belong to where do your kid belong who do thei see themselv as relat to rather than who got the most accur definit of the natur of god let go on thank you for that <unk> in florida welcom <unk> yeah hi two thing on i think the bottom line to thi whole thing is know the differ between right and wrong and if peopl turn to religion i think those ar the same peopl that havent accept respons for their own action as grow up and theyr look for leadership to also accept the respons now of be o k to be good i wa rais veri young by my father who taught me that there wa a consequ to everi action that i took and i have alwai taken that into consider social and also in my busi and i live by my own belief and im at peac well you know that veri interest becaus let me go to gretchen <unk> gretchen you mai have children who ar go to see you in a veri orthodox religion and you mai have reject the religion of your grandpar if not your own parent and who mai now reject your religion and on ha to ask ar you set yourself up for continu from on gener to the other right i think that a difficult question and on that iv talk about a lot with some friend of mine i think what import is that i give them a base that i give them someth to go by so your sai that the caller for exampl she ha her own base right caus she mai not need to look outsid right and as she chose to stai with the valu that her father taught her she veri well could have left those and could have gone to ani number of thing so whether thei follow you is not the critic thing it that you have someth to follow and thei make a decis about how theyr go to ye and i hope that i give them someth someth that mean a lot to me and if thei choos to reject it it go to hurt but theyr go to be old enough to make their own decis and i would hope that mayb on dai thei would come back also like some of the peopl ar do right now thank you more from our audienc and then well get right back with more of our coupl here todai two on two six four three zero zero seven seven as we talk about a religi reviv marc fireston in orthodoxi you have ritual you have tradit you have continu you have the law you have to weav that into your entir lifestyl do you not that for sure from the moment you wake up as an orthodox jew to the moment you go to sleep there ar choic to be made so i want just to point out that it not i cant sai it a simpler system we have three thousand page of <unk> to look at for most decis in our life and grant it more difficult it lead to a more joy exist but there wa on point on want to mention in regard to rabbi <unk> i hope he listen im right here marc the jew luckili weve been on of our trademark is question so on of the area which i respect about judaism wa the integr that there no question not ask i look as i becam religi around twenti six twenti seven year old i look at the evid to support whether there a god in the world number on and whether the jewish tradit realli wa the authent system for a jew so it not a simpl choic for a jew for the jewish peopl but for three thousand three hundr year weve been make that choic and it is a difficult on and not a simpl on but it doe lead to a happier lifestyl i think and a true lifestyl for a human be for a jewish human be i should sai the nice thing about it is it put you in touch with commun so you dont have to do it alon on of the thing that bother me about the group that you were studi doctor roof is the stress on individu i just dont think it work i think you cant realli get what religion offer you all by yourself go on on on with god it got to be part of a commun and i suspect what the <unk> have found in lo angel and what the other group have found and what you found pat is that when you want to do someth which is right but not easi you not onli have god to lean on youv got a support commun of peopl you love cherish and respect to sai we ar share thi quest with you and actual i want to just throw on last thing in with the group we learn with which is an organ call <unk> the rabbi who ar orthodox actual were not alwai orthodox so thei themselv had gone through the question as rabbi <unk> point out it true the question process if difficult by yourself but when you have rabbi who have actual been through it themselv it doe make it a lot easier for you mai i just go to mr roof for a respons for a quick moment and then well come back to you then you cant realli pick and choos i mean part of what i hear is youv got to pick a religion and get into it and immers yourself and you cant take a littl bit from column a and a littl bit from column b well both of those pattern actual happen peopl do pick and choos but usual it within the context of some religion that primari it a commit to on tradit but with some pick and choos of the theme that ar import within that tradit what i think is veri import to recogn here is that there is a quest for commun and what differ it seem to me for boomer todai is that mani boomer ar look for a congreg or a group where thei feel comfort with that kind of quest but worri less about what particular tradit it is let me go to beth for just a moment beth we brought up the issu of femin and although we have not discuss thi long we realli must becaus it is an increasingli grow and evolv forc here in thi countri and mani of the thing that islam sai wa said by rabbi <unk> and that is that there is a provis of safeti given to me in orthodox judaism some of that sens of what other would call second place is your life right let me just sai when i went to colleg the feminist movement wa you know veri big and strong and my husband <unk> me he alwai sai im an ex feminist but i still think that i am a feminist i just think that my view have chang a littl bit or the framework ha chang femin wa born becaus women werent feel valu for what thei were do and thei want to feel more valu and thei felt that thei would find that valu by go out into the man world if you look into you talk to women who have been orthodox jew all their live and you talk to them about thi theyll sai that thei never felt that thei never felt that thei were not valu if anyth thei sai you know men place them on a pedest in fact everi fridai night on <unk> there a song that jewish men have been sing to their wive for two thousand five hundr year call <unk> and it prais the women for everyth that thei do thank you for answer that im go to take anoth call quickli as i go to jami in pennsylvania welcom jami hi i just have a few point to make number on i think it wonder what go on if there a genuin turn to faith and religion if it go to enrich peopl live and enrich societi but i think there anoth side of it and that the polit i think fundament is a danger forc in thi countri and if we listen to the messag that come out of mani fundamentalist preacher it not on of love and reconcili let have a quick respons to that if i mai let me go to you first pat i mean thi is a countri of the law of the land and the law of god ar sometim said to realli be the primari law by some peopl that becom a problem ye it absolut is but i think the word fundamentalist in the religi sens can be veri charg and if you look at it what i defin what our church is about is realli much more histor <unk> the <unk> the time that you realli return to a <unk> understand of the bibl and you cant get too far wrong frankli veri quickli jai i want to ask you a question for when we continu and it ha to do with a number of christian that we know or jewish peopl that we know whose religion is complet <unk> in an hour in church and in synagogu and whose live ar veri differ from that im curiou to know if you see chang in the peopl that you ar around that that split is diminish that question for you when we continu also more of your comment and question two on two six four three zero zero seven seven rabbi and mr roof im kind of interest in know befor i go back to jai whether were talk about individu need or a whole commun of tradit ar we start someth new or ar peopl just us it as anoth form to satisfi person need i think mani of the quest todai in return to religion and spiritu quest have to do with satisfi veri deep person need so i found in my research that mani peopl shop around look for a congreg of whatev faith or denomin it might be to see if it fit comfort with on own person need so it clearli a veri subject approach to the search for commun befor i get your respons rabbi let me go to jai with that veri question that the question the idea of be involv in religion on sundai for an hour or on a <unk> morn do you see peopl behav realli integr it into their live just as pat wa talk about befor sonya i do veri much in the respect that im on of those babi boomer who never left the church and came back but have been a part of a church sinc i guess the time i wa born but have physic gone to church and had no differ in my life so i would have to sai yeah it got to make a differ you can go and sit in a pew sundai after sundai but it doe have to make a differ and that a choic i woke up first of thi year and decid for three year i had sat in a pew and given noth back to the church and realli had not made a lot of differ in my life so ye it ha to make a differ in your life and rabbi can you do thi as an individu well sonya on of the beauti thing about the jewish tradit is you cant get awai with that it defin how you live your religi life in the wai you eat the wai you speak the wai you relat to other peopl the wai you earn and spend your monei it not simpli what happen in the synagogu but in term of what wade wa sai a moment ago i think the most excit and the most challeng thing that go to happen in religion in the twenti first centuri is thi tension between individu choic the buffet tabl instead of the prescrib menu and the search for commun can you creat a commun becaus i think you need the sens of commun where everybodi defin what he go to take and what he go to reject for himself it could be fascin to see where that goe you agre with all of that ye i would just like to sai i think it not just thi weird self help thing that your just go to get better in your own life it is realli a call to behav quit a bit differ and to work through and to figur out what ar we go to do about homeless realli what ar we go to do about social activ ye absolut and it a real call in christian everi time you meet christ he sai go ye and it not just enough to get heal it go ye and of cours we hear that in term of our previou caller who talk about thing that happen at abort clinic for exampl and the shoot of the doctor or we someth in waco texa and we hear about your nod and sai what im sai that that is clearli not part of what is the <unk> bibl i mean that is not ani part of what thi religion is about it is the counterfeit it is on hundr eighti degre awai from it but were call to be activist social to go work in the homeless shelter and to make a differ genuin in peopl live let go to judd in alabama now hi judd yeah i have a question i thought a lot about the stage of faith in my own person journei that i have gone through and the differ stage as a teenag and as a young colleg student i wa veri interest in the fundamentalist idea veri conserv theologi becaus it had a lot of the answer it had the right and wrong and as iv grown iv realiz that i dont need all the answer and i can search those out for myself and there more ambigu to my faith and i wa wonder if that make a differ in mayb what church you decid to go to or whether or not you go from a liber church to a conserv church and then back and forth and kind of how that own process in your life make a differ in your church sonya i can speak to that clearli it make a big differ whether on is look for absolut answer or whether your look for a church that help you or synagogu or a mosqu or whatev that help you in a kind of spiritu journei we have boomer on the religi right and we have boomer on the religi left boomer in the middl there a lot of varieti out there and clearli on of the thing that oper in that cultur of choic and our religi choic is whether or not on is look for clear cut answer versu a commun as rabbi <unk> refer to here that will somehow sustain you and help you in your own person quest so what excit to me about the chang in american religion with the boomer is all of the great varieti we see todai with respect to individu religi altern well you know wade until veri recent i think thi is a jewish christian differ that judaism while it saw itself more as a famili and less as a faith system that we were a peopl befor that had religi content and you can toler a whole lot of religi and theolog differ within the famili and your book testifi to thi fewer jew todai ar start to see judaism that wai and more and more theyr start to sai well thi is a decis im go to make whether i want to belong to all those peopl or not that correct you know as i have been listen veri carefulli to all of you it clear that everybodi ha a littl someth differ in their interpret and their percept and i clearli heard some peopl talk about direct gretchen realli talk about the fact that there wa someth laid out in a wai that the direct wa there and jai and ginger realli be refil again and that wa clear to me and pat as a wai of put togeth busi and on person life and the <unk> as realli the wai thei live and the stori of their life be plai out with thi whole set of rule which thei lovingli take into their live but what i heard most of all wa a real sens of inner peac i mean i have been talk to peopl todai all of whom seem in their presenc to know who thei ar and to know what thei believ in and that is just a love gift for me to receiv from all of you and i thank you for all of that and for be here todai ill be right back thank you for join me todai tomorrow how can the famili of a rape

84,284,welcom back on incom tax dai two senior clinton offici suggest the wai to financ health care might be a nation sale tax the vat or valu ad tax but other top administr offici downplai the likelihood of a vat i think someon wa candid and said that on of the mani option that is be consid ar the work group have thei examin the possibl of a vat ye thei have ha it been present to the presid ha he made a decis no he ha not reaction on capitol hill wa not enthusiast when you talk about valu ad or sale tax your hurt the poor peopl and that i think is what democrat ar more concern with than anyth els at the same time the presid propos compromis of hi econom stimulu wa reject by the senat republican leader it couldnt be wors time were try to the presid try to tell everybodi we need thi stimulu packag and then somebodi drop a new tax idea out there that got to scare a lot of taxpay who ar alreadi frighten becaus of the other big tax packag mark why is bill clinton float a valu ad tax right now al <unk> entertain i dont know i dont know why he do it sure there a coupl of obviou reason on you turn it on it a spigot full of monei it just produc a great amount of monei on hundr seven billion dollar on estim the congression budget offic came up with even if you exempt food and other necess your talk about half fifti billion dollar just about the price at least a good part of the price you need for a nation health plan al danni rostenkowski the chairman of the wai and mean committe is absolut right it a tax that hit not on a fair basi it hit the bottom the poorest fifth of american it go to take five point four percent of their incom the top fifth sit over here to my immedi right it would take less than on percent of hi incom i think for ani tax to work especi if it a democrat tax it such a major chang there ha to be a sens of fair and that miss i think you were talk about your far right mr novak my far right excus me bob i would think if mark right i would think you would love thi tax you love tax for the poor rather than wealthi peopl it is and also if it will replac capit gain tax and corpor tax would you like it it a terribl tax and it not go to replac the incom tax and corpor gain tax we have an emin member of the wai and mean committe it not go to happen the troubl with the peopl in the nation associ of manufactur is theyr unrealist thei think thi is go to get them off the hook from pai tax and it not the big industri american industri also think that it go to be a help for export it isnt what it realli go to do it go if it came in it would realli hurt entrepreneuri develop it isnt so bad on poor peopl as it is for peopl try to make a live becaus with an entrepreneuri firm becaus everi stage of the process of a product now get tax thi is just a terribl idea and it wa donna shalala who doesnt know anyth about washington alic rivlin the deputi director of the bureau of the budget bureau who should know someth about washington thei just see all those greenback and got <unk> sandi i think it wa like when thei float the cola you know were go to clamp down on cola dure the budget process i think it wa put out there so what thei do come up with what thei actual do come up with will look more reason im not sure it wa a deliber trial balloon a few member of the administr said thei thought it wa be consid it on of numer option here the dilemma in a word the clinton ar lead an effort for health reform we need it in thi countri we need it badli we have thirti seven million uninsur in order to contain cost in an effect wai it better to get everybodi in but if you have cost contain it not go to work quickli enough so you recaptur from the save enough to spread insur to all the uninsur so you have to look for addit resourc that in my own view i think thi propos will not surviv al gore said he didnt think it would happen i think there not onli a question of fair there the question of whether you can add a veri substanti addit tax at thi point even for as good a caus as health care and i think the answer is you cant do it the emphasi is go to have to be on cost contain so to paraphras mark that dead that right mona bob dole reject the stimulu thing bill clinton is up in pennsylvania try to put pressur on peopl like arlen specter will that pressur work on ani of those moder republican for hi econom packag no no i dont think so i think that bill clinton ha succeed in unit the republican to a remark extent and remind them of what it is that thei oppos bill clinton by propos thi vat at least float it ha shown that he believ the troubl with america is that american have too much monei in their pocket and that the govern need to take more of it in the form of b t u tax incom tax and now even sale tax which is what a vat is a nation sale tax thei ar <unk> by a larg degre the amount of patienc the american peopl have with thi and it could be a polit killer it not the presid propos two peopl said it be consid by a five hundr person task forc well he back awai from it now right he didnt propos it sandi ill give you that no doubt of that but boi the last week or two thi gui bill clinton who wa magic just three week ago look like he kind of bumbl look like he kind of bumbl in the stimulu packag thi whole thing hasnt been handl right is the magic gone i dont think the magic is gone i think it hard work to get thing done in thi countri peopl want chang my guess is there will be a stimulu packag i think peopl realiz we need to stimul job in thi countri and we need to try to do it right awai right awai ill tell you what the problem sandi is with your presid and that why he he your too the troubl with al doesnt understand what it is but ill tell you what the problem is he realli believ that all the growth that you need in thi countri can be gener by the govern you can do it by spend by put these silli make work program out there and to do that you have to tax and tax and tax and tax the stimulu packag goe to the privat sector like construct job let let the privat sector which dont come on line for two year the critic mark i dont think that accur but no it isnt accur but what happen to thi gui is what happen to clinton laser beam approach to the economi it gotten distract it been off there wa a beam in hi ey i dont know let get thi straight al let get thi straight from brother novak i mean the critic of bill clinton dure the campaign wa he wa too close to the big busi interest did i sai that did i ever sai that when did you ever in arkansa the chicken hear me sai that pro busi democrat let

about whether homosexu is a matter of choic or biologi a govern scientist ha uncov what he consid the most convinc evid yet that the tendenc toward homosexu is inherit in some men c n n medic correspond dan rutz report scientist have not discov a specif gene for homosexu but dean hamer with the nation institut of health doe claim to have strong evid that inherit from the mother side can have a lot to do with it that is that the gene plai some role in some individu in determin their sexual orient it doesnt mean that there a singl gene that make you gai or make you straight becaus sexual orient is not a simpl genet trait like ey color or hair color weve done <unk> analysi on over three hundr famili of both lesbian and gai men at a confer on the scienc of sexual orient last februari hamer talk about part of hi work confirm previou studi that show gai men and women ar more like than straight to have gai brother and sister but he also look beyond the immedi famili at least for man we can also see increas rate of homosexu orient in more distant rel and in particular in matern uncl and in cousin who ar the son of matern aunt that observ led research to the x chromosom which men inherit onli from their mother and what we found wa that an unexpectedli high proport of those gai brother share d n a marker on on small region of the x chromosom which suggest that there a gene gene locat there that affect sexual develop the onli peopl that ever put me on toe were gui becaus i wa never realli greatli attract ever to a woman daniel kasperski stori is typic among gai men he sai he tri to be straight but alwai knew he wa differ i did not want to be gai i did not want to choos that lifestyl hamer sai hi studi should lead both gai and straight to a clearer understand of sexual orient on effect that it will have is the demonstr that sexual orient is not simpli a decis or pure a choic it not like decid to have vanilla ic cream or butter <unk> for dessert it more deepli ingrain in a person make up even so hamer admit about a third of the gai brother he studi did not share the genet marker and other scientist warn against read too much into <unk> find ani announc of a linkag ha to be view as a like fals posit until it been replic most investig sai it like genet ha someth but not everyth to do with sexual orient dan rutz c n n medic new we have two guest join us thi morn to discuss the possibl origin of homosexu and the debat that subject uh the subject rais on the phone from the chicago area is michael bailei he hold a p h d in psycholog and is an assist professor at northwestern univers he ha done sever studi on homosexu and hered also join us from our bureau in new york is eric marcu he a journalist and the author of sever book on gai issu hi most recent is call is it a choic answer to the three hundr most frequent ask question about gai and lesbian we thank both of you for join us doctor bailei what doe thi new research mean and how import is it thi research is potenti extraordinarili import if it <unk> and i think it a fine studi and should replic we will have made a tremend stride toward understand the origin of sexual orient mr marcu what do you think well i think it a veri import studi as well i dont think it surpris it doesnt surpris me and it probabl doesnt surpris most gai and lesbian peopl our experi of grow up is that thi is who we ar i it as natur to us as be left hand or right hand or like our ey color but iv got to point out andrea someth you said earlier thi whole notion of lifestyl that be gai is a lifestyl gai and lesbian peopl like heterosexu peopl lead all kind of lifestyl be gai is simpli who i am who we ar as peopl it is not someth that we choos like a lifestyl like live in the countri or live in the citi or be <unk> for exampl doe that infuri mani gai and lesbian peopl well i dont know if it infuri but it frustrat becaus even gai and lesbian peopl often sai thi becaus when you sai someth is a lifestyl the suggest is that it is a matter of choic that you can choos it like chang your hair color for exampl and that is frustrat to hear that kind of languag us so id just like to let peopl know when i hear it that that not the word i prefer and also it so interest to see that c n n is still introduc the subject with some of the same videotap that wa us even four or five year ago it the signatur videotap that whenev you talk about gai men you show gui walk down castro street in san francisco hold hand and photograph them from behind not show their face suggest somehow that perhap were embarrass to be photograph what should we be show well it is dilemma becaus how do you show that peopl ar gai or you want to talk about gai men and show pictur of them perhap you could show gai famili two gui at home give breakfast to their kid or someth like that but to see that same imag over and over again gui hold hand just reinforc show gui hold hand and shot from behind reinforc to american that were somehow embarrass about who we ar and all we do is walk down the street hold hand now what do you think thi new research will do for the gai and for the gai right movement well i dont think itll do a lot i think what itll do is help a lot of parent for exampl feel better about the fact that theyv got gai kid a lot of parent feel terribl guilti think that somehow theyv made their kid gai theyv drop him on hi head or gave their daughter a tool set too earli in life and that theyv creat thi gai child theyv rais a gai child so itll be a comfort to parent theyll realiz that it noth thei did wrong thi is simpli who their kid ar and for gai and lesbian peopl as well theyll no longer have to feel a sens of guilt for be who thei ar becaus thi is someth were born with doctor bailei what do you think well i concur with what eric marcu said except that i would sai gai peopl dont realli need to worri about where their sexual come from becaus theyr not do anyth wrong so even if it were learn thei have noth to feel bad about but in fact thi new research support research that i and other have done in suggest that it not learn what about the concern of gene manipul if thi research is proven true do you think it could lead to gene manipul i think it veri unlik that anyth like that would happen in the near futur for on thing he ha identifi a larg region of the chromosom as a candid it will take a long time befor we identifi a gene specif gene if it there and as dean hamer sai himself it unlik to be a singl gene thing so that thi particular gene would not increas the chanc of be gai to on hundr percent so peopl who were go to abort fetus with thi particular gene would be <unk> fetus that would veri like be heterosexu o k were go to take our first call thi morn from the state

convei similar stori about be unabl to accept themselv at first until thei accept the fact that theyr not go to be abl to chang and that theyr a good person anywai and i think it realli crimin what some therapist and for that matter religi leader ar do to torment thi segment of the popul eric did you have a similar experi identifi your homosexu well i didnt grow up in a christian fundamentalist famili i come from a jewish famili and my mother did suggest when i first told her that i wa gai that i see a psychiatrist and i told her i wa eighteen at the time i told her that i thought she should go to a meet of an organ call parent and friend of lesbian and gai becaus she need help and the fact wa that i wa i realli need the help at the time becaus i wa veri depress about be gai and she need the help becaus she wa veri depress about the fact she had a gai kid but both of us were veri stubborn and i wouldnt see a psychiatrist and she wouldnt go to a meet of parent flag she eventu did

100,558,join us to discuss the pentagon new regul on homosexu in the militari ar retir air forc colonel alan <unk> he is professor of histori at the industri colleg of the arm forc in washington and michel <unk> an attornei with the <unk> legal defens network she is a veteran and a lesbian she sai she left the armi after becom tire of ly about her sexual i dont think that either on of you is terribl fond of thi dont tell dont ask dont pursu polici nonetheless do you think it will work colonel <unk> oh dont put word in my mouth at all first of all anyth i sai is my point of view and it doesnt repres the point of view of the institut for whom i work or the depart of defens no i dont have a problem with the polici as express i think that thi is a perfectli workabl polici perfectli workabl polici all right but you ar not fond of the idea of gai serv in the militari correct no i dont have a problem with gai serv in the militari as long as gai keep their sexual orient to themselv gai keep the sexual orient to themselv there is not go to be an problem we have had gai in the militari sinc the time sinc militari began and it is realli not a problem as long as gai as a matter of fact as long as everybodi keep their sexual practic to themselv it wont be a problem thi is not go to be a problem michel your thought no i dont think the polici is workabl i think it would have been nearli imposs for the <unk> implement regul to fix what basic is a fundament flaw polici and what i find most noteworthi about sec aspin comment is that in them he did not onc mention militari readi as a rational underpin thi polici instead hi comment reflect the languag of compromis and the fear of other peopl as a basi for the polici accord to the unit state court that ar strike down thi polici more and more everi dai that is not a legitim basi for ground the polici we will be back with more discuss on thi topic with our two guest in just a moment first thi break we ar talk about he pentagon new regul on homosexu in the militari with retir air forc colonel alan <unk> and michel <unk> an attornei with the <unk> legal defens network colonel <unk> you were sai a few moment ago that you do think the polici will work is it though a violat of civil right to ask a gai to serv in secret in the militari and if it is not a violat of civil right is it fair well first of all we in the militari dont have veri mani civil right to begin with we discrimin in the militari all the time when it is in the interest of militari effect noth unusu we dont take veri <unk> peopl we dont take veri thin peopl we dont take veri old peopl or veri young peopl we dont take veri tall peopl or veri short peopl we dont take peopl with bad teeth and bad ey discrimin is someth that we do in the interest of get the mission done and the whole point behind the polici is will the polici of bring gai into the militari with their sexual orient be kept to themselv enhanc effect or hurt effect it wont do anyth to effect if the ident is kept to themselv and if you think of it as a sacrific ms battista it is just on of mani sacrific that peopl have to make in the militari includ the ultim sacrific that you can be call upon to make your life so it is just on more sacrific and if you want to serv in an all voluntari forc it seem to me that it is not a veri great sacrific to make keep your orient privat ms battista you dont commit sex act in pubic nobodi on televis know anyth about your sex life why should anybodi know anyth about anybodi sex life um i i would prefer to ask the question myself here but i understand the point that you ar make michel is the us of the term a violat of civil right then perhap the wrong term i dont think so i think that is exactli what it is everi indic that colonel <unk> mention in term of how the militari discrimin is directli relat to job perform unlik thi polici we have exampl of openli gai peopl and petti offic keith <unk> and marin sargent justin <unk> who ar serv todai and ar serv well and show that gai peopl do perform the job well in fact there wa no disput about the job perform of gai peopl in thi whole nation debat over the last year regard conduct standard gai and lesbian peopl ar prepar to abid by the same conduct standard as their straight counterpart as long as thei ar appli <unk> and i think that is what is at the gist of the unfair and i believ the <unk> of thi present polici that standard ar in fact not appli equal to straight and gai peopl and we could not agre more that someon sexual behavior should stai out of the workplac unfortun the exampl of tailhook show us that that is not alwai so i think perhap the on part of the phrase dont ask dont tell dont pursu that mai caus some legal problem is dont pursu becaus the bottom line is that if you ar found out to be gai you can be dismiss your concern about that i have some sever concern that the provis on which i have been brief on the polici that the administr ha cite as their protect for <unk> realli ar inadequ in the form in which thei current exist thei ar veri vagu and without a veri strong leadership emphasi throughout the chain of command pursuit will continu in fact sinc the presid state hi intent in juli to end witch hunt my organ <unk> legal defens network ha document evid that thei continu along with other abus in the field and we have no reason to believ that these new regul by themselv will stop that colonel <unk> do you think that eventu the pentagon hand will be forc by these issu go to the court number i think in the long run if it eventu will reach the suprem court becaus somebodi will push it to that level and i think that preced and past preced ha the court allow the servic to carri out personnel polici when the servic in their best judgment think it is in the best interest of sound militari polici and militari effect to do so so i think that when it reach that particular level none of the decis that have been made so far that have been kei decis have been made unanim in ani case and i think eventu that the court will allow the militari a thei have in the past to do the thing that ar necessari to make an effect militari it is a uniqu wai of life with a uniqu mission there isnt anyth els like it and almost all other comparison realli all other comparison to all other profess realli fall short for that reason secretari of defens aspin said that he did not feel that thi polici wa forev that it wa bound to chang again i would like to ask both of you if you might predict if you will which wai thi polici might chang again colonel <unk> that hard to sai the devil is in the detail and how the regul ar written which is what we ar miss right now what is happen what is go to happen at the base level with the dont pursu aspect of thi the wai that it is probabl go to be interpret unless there is a valid complaint of a homosexu act the variou investig agenc will not be abl to pursu if that in fact is the wai it is carri out and it is carri out dilig that wai i realli dont see anyth other than sand the rough edg in the futur thi polici dont ask dont tell dont pursu if it is carri out that wai nobodi ask nobodi tell and nobodi pursu unless there is an act and a homosexu sex act is just as reprehens and no more reprehens than a heterosexu sex act both be open to prosecut and both be open to dismiss michel quickli the last five court that have look at thi issu have found the polici to be unconstitut so the momentum is build in the court inde to chang thi polici what the last year debat and these regul make more clear is that the polici is base on the fear of other about gai peopl and the court have said that that not a basi on which to discrimin so i would i dont like to make a predict about the court but the momentum certainli is toward strike down thi polici,

107,809,we want to go live to new york citi now where basebal owner ar hold a confer a new confer that is after meet in negoti earlier todai richard ravitch is speak he the owner negoti let listen in list of propos which thei did not discuss thei have it to us in write we will studi it and respond to it veri soon were go to meet tomorrow number two we discuss again there wa consider back and forth on the merit and <unk> arguabl <unk> of a salari cap and how it would affect basebal and how it effect other sport i would have to sai probabl that the lion share of the discuss had to do with the issu surround the pension fund and id like to take a coupl of minut and just explain that as best i can we had an agreement with the player that wa sign dure the nineteen nineti negoti it wa a four year agreement and it said veri specif what the owner should contribut to the fund in each of the next four year and it said on it face that the owner were under no oblig to make ani contribut to that beyond the term of the agreement now the simpl fact is that peopl have burden and benefit from collect bargain agreement and thi issu the issu of that were debat right now is how to negoti a mutual accept collect bargain agreement if the player had intend had want to gear the payment of the pension fund to the all star game as thei have suggest thei ar somehow by some mysteri process entitl to then the agreement would have said that but it didnt sai that thei didnt bargain for it and thei arent legal entitl to it we have made it veri clear to them that we ar go to expect when our collect bargain issu is resolv obvious we will resolv the issu of the pension contribut as well let me sai veri simpli that when the owner announc in the begin of the year that thei would not lock out thei assum a terrif risk that the player could strike on ani dai and caus a massiv disrupt of the game it wa a risk that we took none the less we commit not to lock out we further commit and confirm in write that we would follow the expir collect bargain agreement and honor it and not attempt to chang it thi wa a commit made last januari i believ and through open dai and anybodi who would have expect that that commit wa a commit to pai pension fund oblig could not have understood that letter there wa no commit to meet ani oblig on ani expir agreement whatsoev the issu here remain on singl issu and that is that the busi environ in which thi game is be plai and the econom forc that have an impact on basebal requir for the sake of the game a chang in the system and the propos we made will in my judgment give the player an opportun to earn more and more monei in the year ahead and the guarante that we gave them assur them that thei will not make less than thei made thi year id be delight to answer ani question ye do these talk have a sens of urgenc yet oh i think everybodi in the room is veri consciou of the consequ of go out on strike consequ to the game consequ to the owner and consequ to the player is the fridai miss or the august first miss payment or non payment add anoth wedg into these negoti and ar thei take well i think if the union wish to character it as an act of bad faith but again you know the simpl fact is in negoti that employ take great risk when thei enter collect bargain agreement and so do employe through their union and when strike occur the employ is depriv of the revenu of the game and the employe of the employ ar depriv of the benefit that were accord them when the collect bargain agreement were in full forc and effect and if there is not resolut of thi and i dont mean to suggest that i think there wont be i have still everi expect and certainli everi hope that thi will be resolv in a veri time fashion that thi issu will get resolv easili and that nobodi will end up be injur as a result of it but there ar risk involv in strike there certainli ar to both side did you sai your meet tomorrow with the player correct no i think tomorrow the meet is go to be just with union offici and ourselv to discuss a number of technic issu is thi a hurdl that is <unk> befor you get to the salari cap or is thi take up a great did thi take up a great deal of your time todai well it wa discuss extens todai i dont think it is an insurmount object the parti still have to come to an agreement an over all agreement on of the thing to be resolv is the pension system and the payment to it and how thei come whether it in our propos that wa part of the gross compens to be paid and would be determin accordingli or in view as otherwis when wa the date that thi wa paid last year i believ it wa paid on august first last year jerri that what the contract call for so thi august first deadlin it not a deadlin it wa a contract that requir a payment on august first the previou contract the contract that expir thi last april that correct it expir thi last april bad faith a term that be bandi about now is give and take normal negoti is thi the first time im unawar of ani situat in which an employ make a payment when he not <unk> oblig to do so dure the cours of collect bargain mr ravitch we have heard you and mr <unk> and other sai that there ar nineteen club lose monei could you tell us would you list the nineteen club nobodi said that frequent i have said repeatedli that the project the individu club project that were given the union reflect that fact but the burden of the argument here is not the poverti argument the issu is our right to bargain for our total cost of labor and as youv heard me sai you dont have to prove your poverti to have a right to bargain ar you sai that there ar nineteen club project to lose monei or nineteen club lose monei there ar nineteen club that provid project to us which we share with the union with the union that show that by the end of thi season that thei would lose monei and i want to make it clear becaus the union correctli made on point todai and that is that in those project there wa no project of the world seri and <unk> gate receipt monei and there wasnt becaus thei were individu club project and no club project at the begin of the year an assum revenu from the world seri caus no club know whether theyr gonna be in it or not would you be unwil to tell us the nineteen club that ar project to lose monei could you tell us no becaus individu club financi data is not someth that the owner feel thei have ani <unk> to share with the public thei feel thei have a right to share it with the player and thei have done so can you turn it around and give us the nine club that ar make monei jerri i wonder when i meet the gui who can <unk> but not add in the event the post season is plai what would that number of club lose monei becom pardon me in the event that club receiv from the central fund the project gate receipt and televis receipt from the post season what would that nineteen figur chang to ron let me answer it thi wai the project includ and assum an amount of revenu from the broadcast network the onli thing that wa exclud wa the gate their share of the gate receipt and rob correct me if im wrong but i think rob ar you still here number i think it about twelv dollar gate receipt which would go to the win or the club that particip in the division playoff the <unk> and the world seri so it not ascrib to ani particular club run it not in those individu project so what impact that would have on the club depend on who the winner were given that the club mani time in nineti eighti five eighti on eighti go back forth predict financi doom and gloom and it turn out not to be the case why should we believ it thi time ron i have to sai again that the econom of basebal ar as well understood by the union as thei ar by the owner we certainli disagre as to what the futur go to be like and how it would be impact by player compens system but the basi for thi propos the basi of the owner posit is veri simpl we think that there ar a grow number of club that cannot afford to field competit payrol and we think the system ha to chang in order to insur a degre of competit balanc in the game and two we have a right a fundament right to bargain for our cost of labor and were go to do that and you dont have to prove your poverti in order to have a right to do it do you sens that there a groundswel of support out there among the gener public for the salari cap mayb a feel that the player make too much monei i think in all candor there a groundswel of opinion that sai that theyr realli veri unhappi that on group of millionair is fight anoth group of millionair and that theyr go to be depriv of the game of basebal given that the pension the fund for the pension fund is link to the all star game why it is not link to the all star game clair there is noth in the agreement that creat that linkag whatsoev but there is a tradit i thought it wa organ for the pension as i understand it murrai the that there the time of these payment wa gear to these payment ar made by basebal central fund and that the time of these payment ar gear to richard ravitch the negoti the owner hold a new confer in new york,

hi mother intermitt not constantli and so we knew that hi head injuri albeit it had been sever wa most like go to improv on dai four craig wa move out of the pediatr intens care unit so he could begin the long and critic process of rehabilit much of it to happen right here in thi room but as he began doctor warn that even though he wa start to took pretti good he still face a veri uncertain road back from the effect of such a seriou head injuri dai eight craig wa well enough to talk to hi parent and hi uncl can you tell your daddi do you rememb what happen i wa in the basement i wa swing on the pole and i fell and hit my head craig is <unk> quit well with us yet he not normal by ani mean at thi point craig think is not normal he doesnt rememb as well and just within the last dai or so ha he begun to rememb from dai to dai hi abil to learn hi abil to interact social with hi friend with hi parent is not normal yet can you swing around here dai twelv craig seem to have made consider progress he is talk and move around hi think memori and physic skill ar improv hi parent sai he is practic back to normal but the rehabilit specialist can see that craig still ha signific problem okai walk the same speed as me craig parent sai he wa veri athlet in summer camp he would alwai win the race and he could <unk> by ag four first rehabilit specialist and go forward on the balanc beam but thi boi who also excel at gymnast still need assist to just walk on the balanc beam he often stumbl first rehabilit specialist great okai put your right foot and when ask to hop on on foot it is obviou that the injuri affect on side more than the other okai now try to hop three time in a row on two three good good job now try it with your left foot i think we can see craig when your try to put togeth all thi stuff do the jump togeth and the hop it get a lot harder to do it all togeth at the same time and do it right but were real glad that your do better hi mental deficit ar also evid in simpl everydai task for exampl when ask to wash hi hand he ha troubl with the sequenc of action he <unk> the towel first no i dont think we do that no let try again you need to right do you need some soap none of thi surpris the doctor it is typic for seriou head injuri patient to have a long period of physic and mental defici though the younger the patient usual the quicker the recoveri right now craig is probabl function at about on year less than hi chronolog ag in term of hi abil to rememb to think to reason and doctor adair sai on of the biggest problem for children with head injuri is that thei look normal but thei know theyr not therefor understand is critic when everybodi around him sai craig you look so wonder you look so great you look normal and craig know he not hell be put in a posit of sometim feel like he ha to defend that he not okai which is a terribl difficult posit for a child to be much less an adult dai fifteen craig <unk> leav christ hospit he had enter in a coma possibl close to death but now becaus of a lot of peopl some he saw some he didnt a famili prayer have been answer oh what a miracl or so it seem how will craig do will he make a full recoveri he alreadi made a full recoveri physic and mental he make improv he return to school thi week part time but that will take a while longer it hard to sai tim you were an activ emerg room physician werent you in the seventi right how differ is it well the big differ as we see in thi piec from what we had back in the seventi is the readi avail of the cat scan to get a pictur of the brain what a differ that make so you know immedi what your deal with and whether surgeri is need i think that the huge differ todai thi child might have di could have or certainli wouldnt have been handl as well that a wonder tool we critic the cat scan a lot but in the emerg room here it absolut vital and to see it step by step as we did becaus our camera were there fascin thank you your welcom

114,300,and so the presid complet in forti five minut hi second formal new confer here in the east room of the white hous have travel most of the alphabet at least from bosnia through waco with a stop at stimulu right in the middl <unk> the question wa rais did you underestim the power of bob dole let find out about the power of bob dole the senat minor leader wa listen to the presid as he wa speak todai he said sir he thought that he might get four defect presum from your parti befor he got defeat in the stimulu plan can you help him out on thi well he had four or five defect from hi parti i think that where the defect came from i dont think we were never in danger of lose anybodi on our side becaus we had constant contact with on anoth we were try to resolv some of the concern that some of the senat justifi had to see if we could resolv it and could settl it in good faith but our view wa that senat byrd sort of underscor last night he didnt he never mention the word compromis the democrat didnt want to compromis i think thei got the result thei want we save the taxpay a lot of monei now thei can blame us if anyth goe wrong bosnia were re assess and the same situat prevail in that troubl balkan region ar you at on with the presid on hi current bosnian plan well i think so i share the presid concern in bosnia i think the least we can do unilater is to lift the arm embargo i do i do think we should work with nato forc and nato countri befor we start ani unilater air strike but certainli i would support air strike all right our senior white hous correspond wolf blitzer ha been listen and he can now come in and join thi convers wolf o k senat dole i wa curiou the presid spoke at great length about hi assess how he done so far dure hi first nineti or so dai next thursdai will be dai on hundr what your assess how ha the presid done so far well ill give him an e for effort but i think beyond that were go to reserv our final judgment until the on hundredth dai i just think there have been too mani thing come at us in the last on hundr dai everi dai is some kind of a new spend program or a new kind of a tax and i think the american peopl ar a bit <unk> now about what presid clinton realli ha in mind for them if he doe go forward next week or in the dai that follow with some sort of new polici toward bosnia lift the arm embargo or perhap even these air strike would you support that and would congress go along with that kind of dramat chang in polici well i cant speak for my parti becaus i know thi is not a parti view but i would support the presid in that effort i think the longer he wait the more difficult it becom and it seem to me that weve wait too long we wait too long in the last administr let dont wait too long in thi administr let me ask you thi other question though in thi whole connect with bosnia the pentagon seem to be real nervou about step up ani kind of militari involv how do you get over that hurdl if gener powel and other militari planner sai it a bad idea simpli go to draw the unit state into a conflict that it shouldnt be involv in well i think the big question is the pentagon polici is whether or not it doabl that why were in somalia it doabl but i think the big question in bosnia can we go in and do it now were not talk about inject ground forc at least im not and neither is presid clinton but it seem to me we have to make a fundament judgment to either do someth now or do it later when the serb move into <unk> where you have two million albanian and where you have the potenti there of drag in other countri greec and turkei and macedonia bulgaria albania sooner or later it were go to have to make some move so it would seem to me we need to send milosev a messag he cannot misunderstand senat the circumst of waco and the condit of your william session your parti nomine and director of the f b i what do you believ the f b is action requir in waco were thei correct and were those of the a t f befor them proper also well you know mondai morn quarterback is a pretti stabl commod around thi town id rather wait until we had some object hear were go to have the hear both in the senat and financ committe which im a member and the judiciari committe i think we have some hard question to ask the law enforc agenc why certain thing were done why it wa necessari in the final analysi to expos peopl who did lose their live so but until that time i think we ought to withhold judgment were get a lot of call i must sai call from my state rais critic question about the feder bureau of investig mr <unk> condit as director had alreadi been imperil somewhat by some other intern report that were not too pleas with the action of himself and hi wife with respect to perk do you believ that he should be should final be oh should we sai sacrif on the altar of the branch davidian well i dont believ so but again im not go to make that judgment presid clinton said he wait on a recommend from the justic depart i assum janet reno the attornei gener but beyond that i dont have ani insid inform iv read the stori iv read the alleg iv also read what mr session had to sai in respons to that no visit with him but it seem i just feel on balanc he done a good job senat dole the presid sai he go to be out of town thi weekend will not be particip in the demonstr on behalf of gai and lesbian right ar you go to be out of town do you think republican should be involv in support what the presid describ as an end of discrimin of these american well nobodi want discrimin republican or democrat i think both the senat democrat and republican democrat ar out of town not becaus of thi but becaus of long plan confer we have in wilmington delawar and the democrat ar go to jamestown virginia so well be out of town but not becaus of thi particular event certainli we all <unk> discrimin but we mai have differ on what discrimin is is the presid handl thi issu properli in your opinion is there more or less he should be do well that a judgment call for him i think he do more than he should be do and i think particularli when it come to gai in the militari i think he made a big mistak there that wa on mistak he made in hi first on hundr dai but in ani event he made thi judgment thei were veri support of him in the campaign contribut million of dollar and thei now have an audienc with the presid and again i dont suggest anybodi should be discrimin against in america and if there ar certain form of discrimin that thei suffer from id be happi to take an object view of it mr dole it wa said that the latest flap over the document that more american might have been held p o w than were admit to by hanoi at least thi ha now drawn hanoi into a more forthcom posit theyv given gener <unk> some more document how do you feel about thi situat in which more document seem yet to come well in my view thei alwai give us a littl more when we get near the smoke gun and i wouldnt be in ani hurri in fact i would oppos ani normal of relat with vietnam at thi time i mean you know theyv had fifteen to twenti year to give us document and now theyr do it fifteen or twenti year later weve had famili suffer for all that time not know what the precis fact were about their their son or their husband or their father brother whatev and i certainli think it not a time to discuss normal or <unk> with north vietnam with vietnam at all what is the smoke gun well i mean there a smoke gun i dont know if the smoke <unk> a russian document or not but you know everi time we get close to someth that might or somebodi reveal someth that might have an advers impact on normal relat then thei come up with addit document if theyv got ani more document whatev thei have ought to be made avail to us so we can make a judgment made on everyth not just wait for someth els to happen and sai oh by the wai here anoth document mayb thi will make you feel better senat am i hear some impli critic of gener <unk> who seem to suggest ye that document is authent no no but the inform it contain is inaccur no my critic is the vietnam north vietnames i mean i think thei gave gener <unk> the document onli after the russian document then uncov so no i dont quarrel with gener <unk> i think he a presid clinton said he an outstand american he do a great job public servic right now i applaud him for it no i dont fault him i just fault the vietnames what about the report that wa releas todai by the pentagon on the tailhook investig your thought is it time for the senior command in the navi and the marin corp to get to the bottom of thi ar thei go to get to the bottom of thi ha there been a coverup i think thei will get to the bottom of it now i think earli on thei did not and i think now thei understand theyr under great pressur and if thei need nudg from congress it will come and at the appropri time i would suggest the name should be releas but i wouldnt releas name prematur and perman damag somebodi reput who mai later be proven to be innoc senat somewher in thi next on hundr dai health care and how to pai for it ha got to becom i suppos on of the major issu do you believ that the countri can surviv anoth go round as we did on the stimulu packag and rate thi come war in comparison with the littl dust up weve just had well it wa a littl dust up i call it a bump in the road of thi so call stimulu packag but it the fundament differ in our parti philosophi presid clinton like deficit spend he like tax we dont think most american peopl agre with him and we think that why hi poll number ar drop and why peopl ar sai now that in hi econom plan sixti three percent sai there ar too mani too mani tax health care is go to be anoth thirti dollar to on hundr billion dollar packag and i must sai if you travel around the countri as some of us have done there a lot of nervous out there peopl ar not certain whether thei ought to expand their busi hire more peopl becaus thei dont know where presid clinton is go to take us take us as a countri and take them in their busi so i just think we ought to have a littl slowdown a coupl of forti hour week at the white hous and give everybodi time to catch their breath and the presid time to focu on hi prioriti not everi dai have some new program that cost a half a billion dollar or some new tax like the valu ad tax float around it doe have an impact on the economi of thi countri senat would it be help to combin what seem to be the burgeon inquiri into waco into on hear of some sort someplac that alwai make sens it rare happen but certainli ye wed have on hear instead of four or five or six well probabl end up with befor it over on would be much better and doe thi becom ultim a polit issu or doe it becom a moral nation question i think it a moral nation it not a polit issu in the sens that somebodi try to blame someon and that would be hard to do where you have democrat in congress invest a democrat you know administr if thei did it like thei did investig republican administr i would sai it wa polit it not go to be polit when theyr check their own but we do deserv to have the hear the american peopl need the answer and i think theyll come senat robert dole of kansa the senat minor leader we thank you veri much for your time and your opinion on what ha been a press confer from the east room of the white hous conduct by presid bill clinton hi second in thi first on hundr dai of hi administr,

year old director of the illinoi chapter of the northern hammer skinhead and bob <unk> twenti year old and assist director of the same organ but first i have with me here in new york shari <unk> who made that h b o documentari and who spent time with those skinhead in the documentari in alabama shari what wa it like to be there what wa the feel you had and why do you think the young men that you saw were there it wa fascin to me and i felt like i wa look at someth i had never seen befor which were neo nazi skinhead in america weve been read about them in europ but in fact theyr right here i wa actual stai film a particular group that had a compound in birmingham and it wa run by an older man thirti six year old man and thi wa actual a home to a lot of the kid in the movement so most of the kid who i met had run awai from home or had left their home for some reason and were live with him there and had come from troubl childhood thei espous a great deal of hate and a great deal of languag that you have to wonder in their sixteen or seventeen year if thei had had experi firsthand that allow them to sai what thei did do thei believ everyth thei sai it feel like thei do i mean thei have an intens about it i know thei ar veri young and theyr be guid by the skinhead movement ha a veri strong ideolog that theyr learn shari let take anoth look at a clip from your documentari when i see a swastika i get chill bump on me becaus it repres the sum total of everyth that i fight for and everyth that eventu on dai ill die for it repres the struggl of my peopl to preserv itself in a world that increasingli hostil to white and more and more young peopl have found out that adolph hitler wa right chri <unk> do you agre with all of that ye definit i do sonya you agre with what sai it in your word well i believ were warrior todai and were fight for a great caus which is the white race the white peopl dont have as much pride i think as black peopl or hispan and i think we need someth to unifi ourselv and in the white power movement the nation socialist movement i think that a great wai to unit our peopl let me ask bob thi what is the nation socialist movement what doe that mean and how doe it differ from the wai thi countri is govern nation socialist movement i feel is a great adapt of adolph hitler product everyth he carri out in germani hi econom system hi wai of govern hi wai of <unk> nation pride in hi countrymen and i think that on thing that all american us white american that what we need to do is we need to organ ourselv togeth we need to unifi ourselv and we need to let the govern know that we have a voic now chri let me ask you who arent the peopl that you would includ in thi well the peopl we wouldnt includ in our organ ar of cours the drug user the white trash the rapist crimin just typic peopl we have valu we have moral we have veri strong valu famili orient right but what about the peopl who have been here for hundr of year and also consid themselv american well that fine america is for all peopl but the wai i feel is that separ the race would work a lot better better product among differ race in differ part of the countri it proven in europ europ ha work as a great contin by have the white race separ from the rest of the world and it produc a lot in america the racial tension is boil over and it never shown that the race can work togeth well bosnia hercegovina certainli wouldnt exclud the fact that white can get into troubl with each other chri how would you achiev the separ of the race well i would sai assign separ part of the countri for the differ race who go to do the assign well onc our govern is instal and how ar you go to get it instal what about democrat process well that fine as soon as we open peopl ey and we express our view we never get a chanc to speak as soon as we speak to the public to give us a chanc to open their ey a littl bit then i think theyll understand and chri what is it that you think peopl dont alreadi understand i mean how do you think peopl see you as kind benevol care american try to get thi countri to work more effect for all well through the media thei dont see us as that of cours becaus the media <unk> the bad side of everyth is the wai i feel theyv never seen our organ the wai we work i think we ar kind and care toward our famili and our peopl and were veri hard worker were all work class were all in school where do you go to school im work right now full time how much school have you had i graduat high school with a diploma shari tell me a littl bit about the peopl your with i saw the entir documentari and pre screen it and i saw a lot of young men drunk all the time as i listen to bob and chri talk about drug alcohol is also a drug i saw a lot of peopl who did not appear to be work did not appear to have ani goal ar there differ i mean ar skinhead skinhead or ar there i think there ar differ i truli do and how do you see those i think from what i understood it a veri fragment movement and each littl group is unto itself the particular group that i studi i think becaus thei had the leader and becaus thei had thi compound a lot of the kid werent work and were frustrat by that felt that thei couldnt get job and thei were be discrimin against becaus thei were white chri let me ask you someth somebodi might pose the question to you is it truli that you cant get a job or that your protect job for white in america or is it a fear that the peopl in your group have that you neither have the educ the intellect or the compet to be abl to compet in a wai for job without a kind of white power movement well i think it veri hard for white male to get a job especi skinhead becaus there much prejudic against us i wa lucki i got a real good job and i think it veri hard from peopl iv talk to in instanc iv had that it veri hard for a white skinhead to get a job in societi todai becaus of the wai were portrai and the stereotyp of us but it not true now bob is it that you feel if there just werent so mani other peopl immigr to thi countri and other then it would be easier for you to get a job so ship em out well when you look at immigr you just have to look at on of our biggest argument is you have to look at a lot of the inner citi i mean you have to look predominantli white neighborhood in our neighborhood ar clean there no crime and whether it not specif becaus of black or becaus of hispan but if you go through a predominantli hispan neighborhood or predominantli black neighborhood drug ar flourish gang ar flourish and whether it a stereotyp or not it on thing that you have in those neighborhood that you dont have in predominantli white neighborhood that grow crime so in your view be white and live in white area would mean that there would not be crime and it is by the introduct of hispan and black and other that there is crime o k let take a call we have perri on the line with us from new york welcom ye am i on the line you ar ye my

iv been a skinhead for seven year iv been six year seven year six year how come you gui dont go back to the wai skinhead first start well tell us about that o k skinhead start in sixti nine in england and it had noth to do with racism when it start no it had to do with work class it wa a work class movement let let the caller go ahead skinhead had noth to do with racism what is your point caller and i wa wonder how it chang into racism nowadai now ar you a skinhead is that why your call yeah iv been a skinhead for seven year and what doe it mean to you is it differ from what i hear here yeah it wai differ from what you hear there well tell me well it ha noth to do with racism skinhead nowadai it wa never about if your black or white it wa just hang out and have a good time and it wa a work middl class shari sai no that that not your experi certainli well i think there ar differ kind of skinhead and chri mai know more about thi that there ar anti racist skinhead that look like skinhead thei shave their head and have their tattoo but theyr of a differ persuas on of the thing i find interest as we talk about the differ type of peopl involv that in the unit state and america on of the reason that you can speak out and you can be here on the media is that we have someth call the first amend and you ar privileg to have the opportun to have your belief and to be who you ar dont you find it somewhat contradictori that you want to stop other from their belief their valu and who thei ar bob we dont try to chang peopl mind we dont infring on other peopl right were just express our right our view our right under the constitut we express our view the major of the time other peopl come to us such as peopl anti racist skinhead thei confront us with the fact that we cant be nazi or nazism is wrong were the on that get infring on our right we dont go around tell peopl what to believ tell peopl that theyr wrong for race mix or so your realli a benevol group and you ar nonviol is that correct well were nonviol to a point where peopl ar nonviol with us we equal their terror with our own terror violenc with violenc youd never throw the first punch no i never have but chri arent you the lead singer in a group call final solut ye i am that correct that a veri interest phrase what doe that mean final solut wa a phrase that hitler us for the emigr and if not emigr then forc deport of the jew out of hi countri it wa never us as a stereotyp extermin of the jew it wa never us that wai there no documentari of it your go to tell me i hear come that there wa no holocaust that that is a <unk> of the imagin and a conspiraci by million of peopl to <unk> other around the world is that right i dont believ in the holocaust i dont believ it ever happen i believ that there wa mani death but i think that wa from starvat and you know be veri close in the concentr camp and voluntari starvat and voluntari concentr camp no well the reason germani went into war wa becaus thei were in a depress thei bare had enough monei to feed their own peopl and their own troop of cours theyr go to feed their own peopl first thei suppli the concentr camp with whatev food thei could so thi get back bob then to the idea that if you cant compet legitim then you have to find a wai to compet <unk> so that you have the power mai i ask you do you like the fact that you mai be seen as fear and hate well i think it need to be that wai i think that peopl need to know that were a forc here and that were not go to back down and were not the biggest polit organ in the countri but were work toward it and shari what do you think that we can get out of watch thi documentari i mean what ar we go to hear that differ or more than what weve heard here todai well on of the main theme of my particular documentari is the kid and where theyv come from and that when you offer them a sens of ident and a place to fit in and these ar kid who in my film have had some abus and some neglect then theyr veri prone to that kind of ideolog i think that the human element of that come out pretti strongli in the documentari and do you think that theyr open mind that thei ar capabl of be reach with anoth messag and free to make up their mind about that i think it depend on the case and how entrench theyv becom some of the skinhead in my film commit a were charg with commit a murder so it hard it interest that we have thi as we follow the waco hear which had to do a great deal with peopl see a particular view i thank all of you for be here there much to learn for all of us and thank you for be with me todai tomorrow merci kill would doctor like to be allow more freedom to let the patient love on make the decis on death or do doctor think that theyr the onli on qualifi to make that decis question for tomorrow as i continu to ask why thing ar the wai thei ar a look at our world from the insid out,

136,349,continu now our expand coverag of what some peopl call lawyer bash were join by two attornei with veri differ perspect in san francisco harvei <unk> presid of the california state bar you heard him just a few moment ago and in chicago joseph morri presid of the lincoln legal foundat a free market orient public interest law center gentlemen welcom to you both mr <unk> to you first what would make lawyer bash a hate crime accomplish well the first thing we have to do is we have to stop the lawyer bash that the first thing we have to make sure that the public understand that lawyer bash ha gone too far is go too far make it a crime is onli on part of it okai let me jump in now that mai be not be the solut what is lawyer bash i dont understand is it a joke on the jai leno show is it a speech by presid bush at the convent just exactli what ar you talk about lawyer bash in my opinion is not simpli joke not simpli the jai leno show or mark twain or good thought polit humor it is take an entir group and paint them with on broad brush i took talk show todai where peopl said that all lawyer ar <unk> and <unk> well thei cant all be that wai and that what hate crime and hate speech is like it paint all peopl with on brush even though there variat all across the board and there good lawyer there bad lawyer there lawyer of all color and all <unk> and yet somebodi take it and goe bang theyr all the same theyr all the same theyr all terribl that hate crime joseph morri what your take on thi well i wish it were the case that lawyer were univers respect in a wai there wa a time when we were but the problem is weve got to earn that respect and unfortun in recent year if truth be told thi ha becom an excess <unk> societi in part becaus lawyer have not realli had a sens of the boundari of what the law can accomplish we have intrud law into area where law simpli cant solv problem law cannot be call on to solv everi problem and it not surpris therefor that in the heat of emot in the heat of anger peopl will see lawyer who sometim seem to be hold themselv out as the priest the high priesthood of some kind of system purport to solv everi problem and reliev everybodi of everi kind of fear or respons as somehow fall down on the job if lawyer have a sens proport i think we can weather thi joe isnt that to build a legal system that command respect go ahead mr <unk> if the legal system command respect let get mr <unk> in here lawyer will command respect joe that exactli the problem which is how ar you go to make sure that lawyer ar encourag to take that extra step that thei dont oper in fear that someth might happen to them if thei take risk and that exactli what im worri about is that lawyer will be discourag lawyer who take the unpopular caus the lawyer that take the free case and those ar the lawyer that ar most effect by thi slap dash bigotri against all lawyer as be someth wrong with them theyr all jade for monei theyr all fat tax lawyer theyr all rich mr <unk> we abov all have to be care with our word we run a risk here of <unk> <unk> law of hate crime thi isnt hate against lawyer thi isnt the kind of hate that exist when were talk of bigotri in term of race or religion or nation origin we should be get a messag here the messag here is that the american peopl think that someth is wrong with the wai we do busi and we need to listen carefulli to that let me jump in here gentlemen i want to ask you thi question and mr <unk> i direct it to you first do you realli believ that there is an increas in violenc target against lawyer and that there is truli direct consequ or it is a direct consequ of what you call lawyer bash i believ there an increas in lawyer bash i cant sai there an increas in violenc although weve seen it and it onli anecdot at thi point but there clearli an increas in aggress and the problem is that in the nineti with the recess go on with peopl look for someon to blame for their problem theyr go to turn to the most visibl target that around right now and that lawyer and the more we allow it to becom lawyer the more danger it becom mr morri why not do someth about it then well lawyer abov all peopl should not overreact to a situat like thi and we should certainli not be seen to be engag in special plead if there is violenc against lawyer or anyon els violenc should be met and be met hard but the lord know we should not be carv out law special protect lawyer as against anyon els thi is terribl overreact and i would hate to see lawyer call on restrict on the first amend or thing that peopl might be sai about lawyer in an effort to protect ourselv profession mr <unk> whatev happen to the first amend then im not go to do a thing about the first amend i hope that jai leno continu with hi joke i hope that everyon continu with their free speech but there a point at which it cross the boundari and <unk> aggress on peopl thei ar on the margin youv got to rememb that were talk about peopl who ar on the margin who might commit crime against attornei as a wai of <unk> what thei think is their problem with life or their problem with societi that the danger and i think for so long we have tri to polish the imag of lawyer weve talk about improv the legal system weve talk about how we can help ourselv and weve never done a thing to sai stop it will you stop the lawyer bash it true weve got some bad appl but were do someth about it were try to stop the peopl who accus an entir profess of be some of the <unk> thing iv gotten call todai that i cant even repeat theyr so horribl threaten call so i just dont understand that kind of anger ye threaten call actual threat well there no excus there is no excus for violenc and the threat of violenc that should never be justifi but i dont think we do ourselv let alon our countri a favor when we sai that the problem here is other peopl speech we should be look to ourselv we should be look to the legal system and the wai we conduct our profess if the legal profess met peopl need if our legal system wa clearli perceiv by our fellow citizen to advanc the rule of law we would not have thi problem let look to the caus not to the symptom mr <unk> what trigger in your mind the respons that you made todai the suggest that you made todai wa it in fact thi attack in san francisco it wa two thing on for an entir year as presid of the state bar iv been try to improv the lawyer imag in california and across the countri it tough there lot of peopl that just dont like lawyer secondli we had the incid in san francisco a horribl incid and i dont want to downgrad that it just horribl what happen there and third is that the weekend i wa think about what we at the state bar could do about thi and lawyer could do somebodi call me with of all thing a lawyer about a joke about the kill of the lawyer and i just said enough is enough we cant take it anymor weve got to fight back and it true i dont want to restrict peopl first speech i want to rais the public debat on thi and get peopl off the point where thei stop paint all lawyer with on broad brush and stop be so cynic about our legal system there so much that we can do that is good and we just have to start the debat at a differ level and stop thi snipe that go on mr morri last word to you in about the thirti second remain do you feel that becaus of the posit that lawyer put themselv in in between disput in the middl that thei ar that you ar more a target somehow and that some special step need to be taken well in a wai that true that the glori of our system we ar a system of law our goal is to creat a civil and pacif wai of resolv disput and it is the job of lawyer to step in the middl of it but lawyer must not <unk> lawyer must not special plead our job as what wed like to think of as a learn profess is to protect our constitut order and make sure that the legal system limit itself to those problem it can realli tackl frank i it when we overstep those bound that we get ourselv frank i just want to sai into troubl and call on other peopl to curtail their speech doesnt solv that problem frank thi is no special plea weve go all kind of law that prohibit that prohibit violenc and violent act and threat of violenc against variou group and profess thi is noth more than put us at equal okai gentlemen with ani other profess harvei <unk> thank you veri

158,390,germani restrict new asylum law is be challeng in the german suprem court and the neighbor countri of poland and the czech republ anxious ar await the outcom their border ar clog with refuge some of the nearli four million peopl who have been displac by the fight in former yugoslavia even though thei can no longer get legal asylum mani refuge still try to get into germani to earn hard currenc in the flourish underground economi tom <unk> visit the czech provinc of bohemia along the old east german border and file thi report see thi path ha alreadi been <unk> and there is <unk> in front of us it three oclock in the morn among the <unk> that line the border between <unk> in northern bohemia and <unk> in eastern germani czech border polic have tri to catch refuge on their wai to germani there ar no mountain or river on thi section of the border so it a simpl matter of walk through the field and accord to on of the border polic it made all the more simpl by local with a good knowledg of the area these dai smuggl is the best job for peopl that want to earn a lot of monei and it stress free becaus it not against the law smuggler have new car and as much monei as thei want by dai <unk> look like on larg intern railwai station famili from all over eastern and southern europ kill time on the street and in cafe befor thei attempt a border cross enter germani without a visa is not against czech law and the few who get caught by the czech pai onli a small fine befor theyr then free to try to cross the border again insid the cafe germani in the center of <unk> <unk> a twenti eight year old machin oper from serbia <unk> coffe and smoke cigarett he sai he left serbia in april becaus he couldnt live on a salari of three dollar per month and wa worri that he might get draft into the yugoslav armi <unk> hi wife and two children got through the border last month but were caught by the german polic despit the new german asylum law he plan to try again we walk through the border we walk all the night and then the next dai thei caught us we spent on dai in jail and then thei took us back to the czech republ so if that happen the last time why ar thei go to try again ar thei not frighten that the same thing will happen again i am not afraid that thei will take me take me back to czech republ but i am afraid that thei will send me back to yugoslavia it lunchtim at the refuge camp in <unk> <unk> a former soviet armi barrack about seventi mile south of <unk> refuge who seek asylum in the czech republ must first come here for health care and a short period of quarantin onli three year ago the idea of refuge seek asylum in czechoslovakia wa inconceiv but as the most prosper countri of the former communist block the czech republ is an increasingli appeal option for asylum seeker such as ali dixon a twenti five year old soccer player from ghana i made it from i got a ship and i came down to yugoslavia and from yugoslavia i came down to czechoslovakia did you origin want to go to germani or no no i dont have aim of go to germani i dont like to go anywher here is okai you want to live here as a czech for a while live with czech and work with czech ye of cours ye and work with the czech and live with the czech i dont know much about germani onli i wa told here thei can keep me safe you know peacefulli and my life will be safe that all <unk> sai that he too mai appli for asylum here if he cant get into germani so is the czech republ set to becom the consol prize for thousand more refuge reject by germani czech foreign minist <unk> <unk> think not i am convinc that the number of refuge will be much lower than now becaus most of the peopl go through our countri to germani becaus of the liber asylum law in germani so it mai be that the chang of asylum law will mean in effect solv of problem for us also mani would regard thi as wish think but govern minist ar reluct to discuss the implic of germani new asylum law for fear of aggrav relat with the <unk> nearli all of the refuge on czech soil come across the czech slovak border and govern offici will privat admit that to stop the flow of refuge thei will have to build a formal border with slovakia accord to rita <unk> former <unk> ambassador to the unit state refuge will becom a new sort of disput for the two recent independ republ for the czech republ it an enorm problem becaus these ar just were unabl to cope with there ar estim that there ar alreadi about two hundr thousand illeg refuge in the countri so what doe that mean doe that mean theyr go to be sent back ye well were go to send them back to slovakia where thei came from exactli what the german ar do with us i think that the intent and there troubl down the road obvious becaus we have to sit down with the <unk> and agre it will just be on more on further deterior of our amic divorc there a potenti there for it turn veri nasti at the time of the so call velvet divorc between czech and <unk> last januari both govern promis an open border between the two countri becaus of the german asylum law and the necess to stem the flow of refuge thi promis will not be fulfil to complement the construct of a new

former soviet block must have an invit a return ticket and will have to prove that thei can financi support themselv for nation public radio thi is tom <unk> in pragu,
159,391,welcom back to larri king live the anim that make us happi the charact known round the world the theme park that have come to stand for the ultim american vacat walt disnei mean happi plain and simpl and the keeper of hi legaci want to keep it that wai and now a biograph sai that uncl walt wa actual much more complic a sad cruel man who spi on hi fellow hollywood resid a happi visionari in public a dark princ in privat that the verdict from marc eliot in hi new book walt disnei hollywood dark princ from birch lane press and the disnei famili is mad marc eliot join me now what led you to write thi book well i have some friend who ar a littl older than i am and thei were <unk> in the forti and the fifti and it came up on night that someon said that walt disnei had been the leader of a vigilant organ in the forti thi struck me as quit interest iv alwai been fascin by the polit of hollywood so i tri to research thi particular aspect of disnei life and found that it virtual wa non exist in the author biographi of walt disnei didnt he testifi befor the hous un american activ he most certainli did he wa consid on of the <unk> wit and when he testifi he name sever peopl as communist none of whom wa there ani evid for that particular situat but that wa known that the testifi that wa known right there ar other thing that werent known includ hi be on of the found member of the <unk> the motion pictur allianc which wa that organ thei were refer to in nineteen forti three but most <unk> what i found out when i <unk> the f b i for hi file under the freedom of inform act wa that disnei wa work with the f b i from nineteen forti until hi death and possibl as earli as nineteen thirti seven but doesnt the f b i deni that the f b i hasnt made ani statement didnt william webster make a statement william webster is not in the f b i william webster is well a former head of the f b i a former head of the f b i he act as a matter of fact i dont know how he act is he a spokesman for the disnei famili is he on the disnei payrol is he a spokesman ar you impli that im ask im not impli im ask who he repres and in what capac he said disnei wasnt an employe of the f b i and he the former head and noth could have happen in between disnei di befor he left but he specif said in hi statement that accord to the releas document there wa no evid that walt disnei wa a secret inform that a veri specif comment my repli to that is the releas document ar sixti percent <unk> out and over nineti percent of that sixti percent is <unk> out for reason of nation secur my question is what could possibl be in those document fifti year later there no more soviet union there no more communist threat in hollywood as far as i know world war two is over and hitler is dead what could possibl be a question of nation secur what your guess my guess is that as the famili and the studio have demonstr for the entir cours of the disnei exist thei feel that he is an econom factor and that the imag of walt disnei is preciou and priceless and must be kept intact <unk> at all cost all right but that the famili that isnt the f b i doesnt care if walt disnei make monei or not the f b i as i said hasnt made ani statement i have call upon the f b i now sinc thi <unk> ha begun for lack of a better word to releas all the document that wai thei dont have to take the new york time word thei dont have to take c b s new word or my word or mr webster word by the wai four group have now seen these document i have seen them iv had them for two year the new york time had them for eight week

somehow on that dai thei were abl to put togeth that massiv document in on dai accord to them if we look back to the time though the forti and fifti right if someon were inform for the f b i what terribl the last time i check that wa an american organ i dont see anyth particularli terribl about it ronald reagan did it it wa disclos five year ago that he did it hi code name wa disclos i frankli do not understand the famili incred harsh reaction to what is essenti a proven fact but your call it a dark princ aspect what is bad about inform to the f b i noth is essenti bad about it accord to the circumst unfortun a lot of the peopl that walt disnei inform upon were not necessarili peopl who should have been condemn and punish for the action that thei did that probabl why thei <unk> it out that right so that those peopl wouldnt be mar well except that disnei testimoni at <unk> wa veri damag to the career of three individu particularli as far as be <unk> out that make it wors in the sens that the peopl who ar be accus and then vilifi cant face their accus by the wai the famili of walt disnei declin to appear on larri king live but walt disnei daughter submit thi statement in respons

wai into on of the <unk> hous thi scene so upset the jewish commun in hollywood that thei pressur walt disnei into remov it and when it wa remov he jokingli said that he wa just try to make fun of carl <unk> who wa an enemi of hi in hollywood why did <unk> <unk> honor him with a dinner that is a testament to walt disnei incred p r machin and person charm and hi abil to distanc himself from that own dark side well why would an <unk> go to a dinner which jew ar attend to honor him becaus jew to us a phrase in walt disnei time control hollywood and he wa forev seek part of hi inner conflict

169,412,will the democrat be abl to pull all their faction togeth and agre on the five hundr billion dollar deficit reduct packag will it help the economi or as the republican claim hurt it slogan ar easi tax and spend cut spend first it spend stupid thei all sound so good so that thei mask the realiti ar the republican inde hide their budget shortcom in rhetor thought from washington thi is newsmak sundai with frank sesno welcom to the program im bob franken in for frank sesno our guest todai deputi treasuri secretari roger altman and later senat minor leader robert dole join me with the question is c n ns white hous correspond jill dougherti mr altman let talk about your job which is to run it been call to run the boiler room in charg of the oper to ram thi through congress if youll accept that character and it go to be through the democrat in congress sinc the republican have opt out as you know the democrat ar never accus of be an organ polit parti and that becom evid right here you have the liber who ar sai thei ar not go to accept some of the chang that the conserv have made in thi and the conserv sai accept them or els were not go to pass thi how ar you go to do thi how ar you go to pull all these group togeth well first of all i think the outlook is quit good after all eighti percent of the presid origin budget is alreadi in the hous version and in the senat version and were within about two week of complet thi and that would be the fastest enact of a major econom plan in modern histori the vote were close as you know origin six vote in the hous and a tie break vote in the senat but i think well get there and the reason well get there is that thi plan alreadi is work you know when the prospect of credibl deficit reduct from presid clinton came into view interest rate began to fall dramat that pick up certain credit sensit industri like auto construct and hous and what go on job ar be creat were creat job over the past six month at on hundr forti thousand a month that three to four time the rate at which presid bush did over four year i want to talk about that in a minut but let me get back to the no wai factor you have the peopl from the western state for instanc and you have other who ar sai no wai will i vote for a bill that ha the increas in the energi tax that seem to be necessari to satisfi the liber who ar sai no wai will i vote for a packag that make the kind of cut in the liber program that ar be propos the no wai factor would seem to me to be a place where everybodi ha dug himself into the sand there ar two reason why i think itll prevail the first is that the altern is much wors there no credibl republican altern i hope we can talk about that in a moment so the altern is to do noth and to do noth in other word to fail and not pass a new budget would mean that interest rate would go back up sharpli that usual bad for stock price consum confid would take a hit busi confid would take a hit and thi rate of job creation that i wa just talk about would start to unravel i dont think in the end that the congress is go to want to embrac that the second reason i think that will prevail is that the voter sent a strong messag last novemb to the effect that thei want an end to gridlock and it true that the democrat of cours now control the hous and the senat and the white hous and i dont think that we democrat want to go to the vote in novemb nineti fourth and sai we just couldnt get it done jill on crucial element here is what the role of the presid will be in actual push for hi plan and he went up to the hill thi week had a rip roar speech i guess it wa on tuesdai ralli the troop what ar we go to see now from the presid in term of how what he tell congress specif is he go to tell peopl specif what he want to do or is he go to continu to talk about principl well i think there ar two answer to that jill the first is that the confer is work it make a lot of progress within anoth week or so it should be finish and everyon should know what the detail of the final agreement ar and of cours the administr is present in a lot of those deliber and our view ar be sought too second of all the presid ha thi as hi top prioriti between now and the end the stake ar enorm thi is the type of econom chang and big chang that the voter ask for last fall and he go to be spend enorm amount of time talk with legisl there will probabl be a speech to that nation at an appropri moment and just work on thi non stop between now and then and the enact look you make the point and it a point that be made by everi democrat right now who try to get thi pass that it would undermin the economi if thi wa not to pass but the experi with the budget agreement of nineteen nineti would demonstr to mani that the economi is subject to ani number of pressur you have for instanc alan greenspan the fed chairman up there thi week talk about increas interest rate notwithstand a deficit reduct deal arent you <unk> thi i dont think so first of all chairman greenspan said we need thi five hundr billion dollar of deficit reduct and if we dont get it the impact on interest rate and other aspect of the economi will be neg that wa a veri support comment well nobodi is argu that deficit reduct would be bad it seem that some peopl ar argu that the administr is <unk> the effect of thi given the unpredict of the economi well i think were just tell it like it is that the realiti is that job growth is pick up weve releas an analysi to the effect that under thi plan we think well creat eight million job over the next four year we even releas it on a state by state basi i have it right here just happen to bring it with me happen to bring your prop ye and break down by each state where we think the job will come from either wai most lead privat forecast agre with thi assess on the amount of job which will be creat so i dont think were <unk> it thi is the type of big chang that good for the countri and import for job and growth that the american public ask for last novemb speak of the eight million job it my understand and correct me if im wrong that those estim ar base on overal project for what is go to happen in the futur not necessarili take into consider the presid plan is that correct theyr base on a seri of ye of long term trend togeth with the plan i agre it not the plan all by itself it the econom outlook incorpor the plan but i would repeat you have to ask yourself what the altern and as i said there is no real republican altern thei struck out in term of offer a credibl altern and if thi isnt vote your go to see a seri of bad econom develop as i mention includ go back down on thi job growth rate in the polit sens though why would you want to pin yourself down to eight million job i mean a year or two from now somebodi can pull up the <unk> slash <unk> and sai the newspap report and sai hei where ar those job well nobodi can guarante as you sai that those job will come to pass but it is our best judgment that theyll be creat as i said most of the lead privat forecast agre with that assess and were just tell the american peopl what we think the plan will do o k but let take the republican argument for a second and treat it the republican would sai that ani monei that you tax is monei taken out of an economi that can be spent to creat job by give consum the power to bui and thei sai that the democrat ar too prone to tax and undermin the economi by tax it to death and thei make the point also that thi plan doe just that well let me make two or three point about the republican argument first of all as to whether thi plan is bad for the economi which is a main argument thei ar make i refer you to a bunch of the lead econom forecast who built thi plan into their model and conclud that it will be posit for the economi posit for growth and posit for job but theyr sai excus me thei ar sai that deficit reduct would be posit the argument howev is that there ar better wai to do thi than take tax well but that get to the second point what is it the republican have propos senat dole will be here in a moment the night befor the senat vote on the presid budget the night befor republican threw togeth an altern and what wa in it on hundr billion less deficit reduct and within that fifti billion dollar of cut to be figur out later it wasnt a credibl altern it wa an air ball and most of the press in fact virtual all of the press <unk> it but that besid the point of the question in the brief time that we have left doesnt tax inher hurt the economi by take monei out of it no becaus the impact of thi overal plan the whole plan on the economi will be posit but let just make on point about who pai the tax under the senat bill eighti percent of the new tax will be paid by american earn more than two hundr thousand dollar a year most work american famili sai earn forti thousand dollar will pai about a dollar a week fifti dollar a year we think that a fair approach dure the nineteen eighti the upper taxpay had their effect tax rate go down that realli wasnt the right wai to do it and so we think the whole plan it the wai you ought to look at it will be posit for job roger altman deputi treasuri secretari the man who is run the boiler room at the white hous try to sell thi program through congress among the democrat in congress thank you for be with us in a moment well be join by the senat republican leader robert dole clinton try to actual accomplish someth you cant do that without compromis and i dont think it waver i think it attempt to get the job done he got to have the support of congress he campaign on unlock the gridlock but he hasnt been too success on that not becaus he hasnt tri that becaus those gui up that on the hill dont want to cooper among those who ha not been exactli cooper with presid clinton these dai when it come to the budget deficit is our next guest senat robert dole minor leader of the senat promin critic of the budget plan the critic of your critic is that the plan that your offer do not in fact specif offer ani cut rhetor fog i believ the presid call them yeah well i doubt the presid even look at our plan would be my guess he probabl just read someth that somebodi gave him and your last guest mai not have look at our plan either mr altman becaus i brought a littl chart along under our plan the deficit actual continu to go down and their come start back up in about nineteen nineti eight let talk about what is call your plan thei sai that your plan is a myth that there ar not specif spend cut and theyr just gener area where you well if that the case we took everi spend cut that presid clinton suggest two hundr and some spend cut we put in our packag we have a five year five year freez on so call discretionari spend non defens discretionari spend and we have cap on entitl start in nineteen nineti seven we need some time for the phase in three hundr twenti nine billion dollar without tax but the differ is that in order to make up the lack of tax that you wouldnt put in your so the critic sai you would need to be specif about other spend cut which you have not been in your plan well thei havent thei havent specifi where thei ar we think we were specif we think it a pretti tough vote we pick up a coupl of democrat vote on it and i hear the presid out sai he go to creat eight million new job the c b o said in januari if you didnt do anyth youd creat nine point four million new job so it look like were lose about a million and a half job with the presid plan jill ar you worri i saw a cartoon the other dai where you were depict as darth vader i think as darth <unk> brother mayb but ar you worri about your strategi of sai no to the presid not on the econom plan no i think if we did it on everi piec of legisl there be sai well what ar these peopl up to but were alreadi out front on the north american free trade agreement on the russian reconstruct plan a number of issu that will probabl furnish more republican vote than democrat were not for the big spend bill on the senat floor now ten point eight billion dollar for nation servic we think it sort of underscor the tax and spend of thi administr theyv got a tax bill in congress confer and a spend bill on the senat floor and no wai to pai for it but no were go to cooper and weve written the presid weve set down in fact well work out a deficit packag if thi fail mani republican ar will to do that well as a matter of fact though that someth that need to be discuss in the event that it doesnt pass is it your understand that there would be anoth version of the andrew air forc base summit someth like that and just veri quickli to remind peopl that meant that the parti leader got togeth from both parti and work out someth is that what you would expect to happen well i think it would depend on the presid certainli that an issu but i think it could depend on the presid certainli hed have to take the initi but were prepar to do that weve got some pretti good idea on retroact index of capit gain to make it retroact and prospect do some other thing that mai attract even some member of the black caucu so ar you wait ar you wait then to have the democrat fail and then for the republican to come to their rescu well i dont see it quit that wai i rememb in eighti five when onli on democrat vote for our packag we were pretti upset about lack of bipartisan support as it end up that year we didnt get a reconcili packag but i just sai were prepar to help the presid weve written him a letter myself and senat domenici senat packwood i talk to the presid person i understand that senat boren mai have told him yesterdai that a number of republican ar will to set down so our point is that were not player not by choic were the minor parti but we ar will to provid some help and some new idea if we could get back to specif again some of the social spend issu that ar of great concern to the black caucu what would you do what doe your plan specif get into when you talk about the cut well our plan is not the on that is go to be vote on but i think the problem is thei put in a lot of these social spend issu to offset the cost of the b t u tax well the b t u tax is dead so i think i agre with secretari bentsen who said thi morn on anoth show that you mai not get the full whatev it is twenti on billion dollar becaus some of the reason for that twenti on billion dollar ar gone but i think we have to reduc the deficit we share that view with the presid but we wouldnt do it thi wai we went through thi experi in nineteen nineti and mani of us walk the plank and didnt get much for it thi is not a five hundr billion dollar deficit reduct plan it about four hundr billion dollar but again where ar the specif our specif all right let sai the social spend issu the social spend issu we try to protect low incom program medicaid w i c food stamp we dont increas spend in ani program let talk about a subject that is relat and that of cours is the flood out in the midwest i just got back from there you just got back from there there wa a polit fight about that thi week much to the surpris of ani number of peopl in the hous of repres thei were not abl to pass the massiv amount of flood aid that is need ten million dollar plu now theyr estim the issu seem to be there seem to be two issu on have to do with the measur about urban job but let forget that for the moment and talk about the republican claim mainli republican that you should find cut elsewher in the govern instead of reli on emerg spend what your posit on that well my view is that thi is an emerg like hurrican andrew wa hurrican hugo the earthquak in san francisco hurrican in hawaii and the law provid that you dont have to offset true emerg now we dont want to load it up with a lot of other program we need to keep the so call pork out of it but on the emerg disast itself i dont think it need an offset we need to work on a plan that will do that in futur year and so you contradict the posit of the hous republican leadership that there should be these offset well i dont know whether it wa the leadership posit but i support the presid in thi view thi is an emerg and it provid for by law now that doesnt mean we cant chang that polici mayb next year but how do you do it now mani of the appropri bill have alreadi pass the hous it pretti hard to go back and sai let take on percent across the board so mayb at an earlier time thi year i mightv said ye but i think now let go ahead and get the aid there but let make certain it goe to those peopl whove been devast and damag not make it a big you know a big christma tree have been out there do you agre with the assess that ar come out now ten billion dollar i think it pretti hard to put a dollar figur on it now becaus until the water reced it go to be difficult to estim but it substanti weve got thousand and thousand of acr of crop land destroi in my state you dont read much about kansa or north and south dakota nebraska wisconsin minnesota so you add all those six state up compar to the other missouri and iowa particularli hard and illinoi weve got some real problem veri briefli get back befor we have to go to a break here to the deficit reduct aspect the complaint is that the republican caus thi problem by their reagan and bush presid and now your try to stop the democrat from correct it well you know you think columbu discov america twelv year ago if you listen to vice presid gore and the presid weve made some tough decis some of us still have scar from the deficit reduct theyv had a congress all thi time the democrat have been in charg for forti year in the hous six of the twelv year in the senat the presid ought to

awai we were talk we mention briefli there wa a stori i dont like to involv myself in everi interview in ani interview in fact but i had an accid on a street in washington noth happen fender bender both car ar done fix it over it wa front page i know you read that stori i did read that stori and i read it try to figur out why is thi in the newspap i couldnt get it and that happen to you ye a lot right sure how do you all right i could look by it on dai it kind of funni how do you deal with it on a daili basi you just have to decid that your not go to let it bother you becaus otherwis youd wake up everi morn and by seven a m youd be all anxiou becaus peopl would be write thing or sai thing that you knew werent true and you wouldnt know what to do about it so do you not read it i <unk> it but i dont read it and i try to make sure that if there anyth i need to know about somebodi tell me in case i miss it but you know there just too much to do in life and there too mani excit opportun to worri about what somebodi sai or didnt sai and then try to involv you in it as you found out with that stori which wa a non stori it a non stori but doe the pain ever for exampl when peopl yesterdai i spoke to the a m a in convent and thei were all upset at a front page stori in the new york time impli not impli sai that thei were be critic of your health plan critic of you and thei want me all of them came over to me the presid of the a m a and it wa pleas assur her pleas tell her pleas that stori wrong we didnt boo donna shalala we didnt we agre in principl with most of the health plan o k when you read the new york time you didnt know that thei were go to sai that how did you feel well i wa lucki becaus i had other newspap which report a veri differ stori on the same occurr on the same occurr the same event and i also have been work with these doctor in the a m a for a number of month now and theyv been veri forthright veri help we know where we agre and we know where we disagre and were try to work through our disagr so i thought it wa kind of an odd stori but i made some phone call i found out exactli what you found out which is that not at all what thei intend nor what thei said and thei were sorri that it had happen o k ill get back to health care back to critic doe ani of it ever help you have you ever read thing and said you know there a good point of view ye and you know what i tri to decid to do and i dont alwai do it but here my motto which is to try to take critic serious but not person so that if somebodi ha a messag theyr try to get to you and it a differ wai of look at the world it a differ piec of inform take that serious but dont let it eat awai at who you ar and undermin your sens of self or mayb even destroi a relationship with somebodi becaus thei sai somebodi said someth and you dont go to the troubl to check it out so i try to take it serious but not person all right how about hillari basher there ar basher right of cours i mean peopl around the countri who daili take hillari on right usual on the far right right how do you deal with that i ignor them i realli ignor them becaus theyr usual do it for some kind of person or polit gain and theyr not even attempt to stai within the bound of truth or accuraci and id much rather listen to peopl who ar act in good faith but honestli dont agre with someth that im do or the presid do youv been a public woman for a long time do you ever get to total accept that you dont have a privat life accept that oh i hope not becaus i think without a privat life you cant be a veri effect public person i think you turn into a shell you know in a privat life you think about thing you talk with peopl in an honest and open wai you make mistak and you learn from your mistak i dont see how you can be in public life and make a real contribut if you also dont have some space to be a privat person and i fight veri hard for that when you assum thi job and took over and we talk about activ befor did you sai to your husband give me an area of respons did you know it would be health care why you and health well that a good question larri becaus your healthi well thank good i am you know but why health i think becaus it an issu that my husband care a great deal about and when he wa governor he care a great deal about educ and he ask me to work on educ and we work togeth and then come into the presid he know if we dont solv our health care problem were not go to be abl to deal with a lot of our other problem in the countri and i think he decid that he would ask me to work on thi the wai hed ask me to work on educ now after it happen about a dai or two later governor cuomo wa here and i love him and he came up to me and he said whatd you do have a fight with your husband and i said you know i feel like that mai be the wai some peopl look at it becaus it a huge respons but it wa a real you know it wa a real honor for me to be ask to work on thi and iv realli enjoi it did you know it would becom as hard as it wa i didnt realli know what i wa get into when my husband ask me to do it i knew it wa import and i knew that it wa someth he care deepli about but the amount of time iv spent on it ha you know realli been quit extens you could have front it though couldnt you i mean you could have had all these commiss out and check with you onc a week you didnt have to go to minneapoli you didnt have to do that right well but you could have front it you could have been chairman pro <unk> well that wouldnt have work for me becaus if were go to make recommend about health care i want to know what im talk about and i want to be sure that it the right thing for my famili i want to be abl to answer my mother question when she call me on the telephon and sai iv heard thi what doe thi mean so that why i felt veri strongli that if i were go to do thi i had to realli get into it on hundr percent of the wai how about take the spotlight though there a c n n poll i think it mai have been out todai that ha you more popular than your husband that thi ha been a heck of a week for you oh well how do you deal with that well of cours im grate if peopl think that what im try to do is the right thing and help the poll didnt mean to sai more popular the poll thought you were smarter than your husband well everi woman would dream of that come on ye but thei dont know my husband you know my husband that tick him no not at all it doesnt bother him at all in fact i think on of the secret to hi success is that he is the smartest person iv ever met and yet he so friendli and open and such a good gui that peopl sometim underestim him and that not alwai bad in the busi he in as weve seen in the last sever year doe he ever close a door and go <unk> sure sure you know sometim youv just got to let it out whether it on the golf cours or listen to loud music or whatev it is ye we do a lot of that togeth a lot of fight too number no no we dont how doe hillari let it out well i like to exercis i like to listen to music and like to listen to it loud and sing along i realli do let a lot out that wai i like to sleep and get caught up so that i mayb am a littl better rest than i would be under stress circumst we do a lot of differ thing watch a lot of movi were big on movi rental movi or you get all the new on dont you ye and do you know what youv got a movi theater here in the white hous i know and it is you didnt know that well i didnt know it until i got here and it wa a wonder surpris to find a movi theater you know and you can call up the compani and get the latest film right ye thei send them to us and we ar realli lucki becaus we get to see movi all the time appar everi presid ha enjoi that the last time i wa with your husband he had just seen the clint eastwood movi oh and he love it ye in the line of fire right ye have you got on you like i just saw the ag of innoc which i love i thought it wa the scorses film oh i love it i thought it wa a wonder movi beautifulli beautifulli shot movi as well as veri contemporari even though set in a time past is it differ watch it here than in the theater ye it is but it a theater you know it better than watch it on the small t v screen oh ye you know it doesnt have the same feel as it doe in a theater lot more with hillari clinton on thi premier edit of larri king weekend on c n n dont go awai were back with hillari clinton on thi saturdai night premier edit of larri king weekend what a week ye youv never had a week like thi week never and im glad it nearli over did you like testifi i did i mean i wa nervou and anxiou to do it as well as i could but i like it becaus i thought everybodi wa well prepar thei ask good tough question thei need answer to i wa veri impress with the congress did that surpris you it didnt surpris me becaus iv now spent lot of time up there you work the hill dont you well i do becaus there a lot of good idea and experi up there but i think it might have surpris some of the public who have given the congress a bad rap in you know the past year and i think see the serious that thei brought to thi issu and the question that thei ask i think should be veri reassur to the american public youv work thi issu a long time senat dole ha told us that your a familiar figur on the hill and you work with republican well ye i sure do is thi a concept that you did in arkansa too well we didnt have mani republican in arkansa but did you ever testifi befor a hous or senat committe i did and i spoke onc to the whole hous on educ but you know i wa rais in a republican famili my father wa a veri strong republican except he thought my husband wa a great american but im veri us to work with peopl from differ point of view becaus i think that make for better polici to realli listen to each other and not shut each other off all right do you think now though that what youv succeed in do is frame the issu so that american now regard health as a right i hope so i hope we have frame it so that everi american know that the wai thei should judg what we do is whether at the end of it thei and their famili never have to worri about health care coverag again thei will be secur and thei will have a set of benefit thei can count on no matter who thei ar or where thei work i hope that the wai it been frame all right nowher is it print that it a right right it not a god given right as we have to free speech assembl uh huh uh huh health is not and do you think though serious as you look at yourself youv frame thi i think it is it <unk> life liberti and the pursuit of happi it <unk> a modern complex societi that is spend too much monei for the health care that we have and not even take care of everybodi so although it mai not be list anywher as a right it is a right becaus without it everyth els thi countri stand for and want to do for itself and what everi individu want to do to be respons is not possibl now your a pretti good student you got pretti good grade you read your histori pretti good it been go on a long time harri truman in nineteen forti eight introduc nation health insur wa call a socialist uh huh it never came right ted kennedi had propos republican have had propos democrat why now becaus i think now most peopl understand that it an issu that affect them not somebodi els you know when you have as mani peopl as we do who ar insur lose their insur everi month more than two million and mayb thei onli lose it for a week but mayb thei lose it for a year then it not a problem that happen out there somewher it a problem that happen in everi home everi american know somebodi who ha been shut out of the insur market been deni coverag becaus of a pre exist condit been unabl to move job becaus to move mean thei lose insur been laid off and lost insur when thei thought theyd be emploi forev you can go down the list so now it a problem whose time for a solut ha final come doctor <unk> sai on of the interest thing about health is of princeton when your vertic you can sai hei watch thi cut those cost but when your horizont give me everyth ye right ye so we all want everyth your not ever go to be abl to deliv that right no but we can do a much better job than we do in provid health care in a less costli wai at high qualiti and let me just give you a quick exampl the state of pennsylvania ha been collect inform about all kind of oper let take the coronari bypass someth that you know about right veri well the coronari bypass surgeri in pennsylvania in a hospit can cost either twenti on thousand dollar or eighti four thousand dollar and everyth in between and when the state of pennsylvania look at all these hospit thei decid base on all the inform thei could get that there no better or wors qualiti that correl with ani cost in fact the twenti on thousand dollar oper had better qualiti than some of the more expens surgeri so what wa the price base on so the price wa base on what you can charg and get reimburs for instead of what should thi oper cost and what a fair wai of charg for it and if we move toward a system where instead of pai doctor and hospit on procedur and on individu kind of diagnos we sai here an amount of monei to keep thi popul healthi now go and make those decis we will have more coronari bypass oper be done for more peopl becaus thei will be more afford than thei current ar so get our cost under control goe hand in hand with provid better qualiti to more peopl have been involv in debat i moder a debat onc between senat humphrei and the presid of the a m a at that time about medicar uh huh as it turn out doctor got to like medicar uh huh it gave more medicin to peopl and gave more incom to them uh huh do you think twenti year from todai some two peopl will be sit here sai thei argu about thi onc that exactli what i think will happen larri your absolut right i think in twenti year well look back and certainli our children will look back and theyll sai what wa the argument about how can anybodi deni that weve cover everybodi weve made everybodi secur we have final gotten a control on these cost and weve got high qualiti and that what i hope will happen all right what about lose patient doctor relationship that what happen right now you know insur compani ar decid who you can go see ye you get a book you get a book and if your not on the list you dont get to go to see that doctor doctor ar be told what thei can prescrib theyr be ask to call eight hundr number to ask permiss to do certain procedur the road we ar on now will undermin even more doctor author and their clinic judgment what i want is to move more peopl toward the kind of wai of deliv care that you find for exampl at the mayo clinic the mayo clinic multi special fine institut world renown everybodi know high qualiti theyr abl to deliv care at less than four percent increas thi past year and thei do it by the doctor make a lot of the decis well get a break and come right back with hillari clinton dont go awai were back with hillari clinton who wa just tell me at mayo the doctor ar on salari right that right good salari veri good but not seven hundr thousand dollar a year right well and not on i dont know what their salari ar but it not base on how mani procedur thei do it base on their provid high qualiti care to all the patient who come through the door all right then ar you sai that most doctor want to provid the best care and financ is not their driven forc i absolut believ most doctor do but doctor ar human be like the rest of us if the wai that you ar go to be paid is have to deal with insur compani and the medicar and medicaid program and list everi littl thing you did and have a price attach to it then your more like to worri about how mani procedur you do becaus that how your get paid and that how your satisfi all these peopl interf with you than what i hope will be the new wai of do medicin which is where doctor make these decis and thei decid how much each will get paid and thei set those kind of rule for the system i will feel better about that becaus i will believ that doctor ar final abl to do what thei were train to do and not turn themselv into insur compani repres after the experi of thi week on the hill what do you expect the battl to be like for thi bill i think that there will be extrem on all side of thi there will be peopl make outrag claim and disregard whatev fact and evid there ar becaus thei have a person or polit stake in do so left and right left and right but unfortun more to the right becaus in order to keep the statu quo which is let be honest make a lot of monei for a lot of differ kind of folk thei will have to engag in lot of scare tactic to prevent peopl from get the chang thei want but i realli believ that most of what will happen will happen in what i call the reason middl in both the democrat and the republican parti with a lot of doctor group hospit group other who ar concern sit down and try to figur out how to get to where we all want to go we now have an excel propos from the senat republican that sai look we want to get to univers coverag here how we would do it here what we agre with in term of the presid plan here what we disagre with it a veri good place to start sit down and talk and i think that where most of the debat will be senat chafe who ha a bill of hi own sai there will be a health bill pass by next june give or take a month do you agre absolut agre there will be ye and thank to hi leadership will a lot of the chafe bill be in it a lot of it will be becaus senat chafe and i talk the other dai that you know on about fifteen issu we ar veri close and we need to clarifi what our differ ar and make sure that we cant get even closer and then there ar a coupl of issu where we have some seriou differ but thei ar within the same univers theyr all try to reach univers coverag theyr all try to control cost so im veri confid that what senat chafe ha said will come to pass senat dole said that abort could wind up out of thi it in mani plan alreadi becaus it could be the <unk> to get the vote you need do you see argu about abort in the health plan well im sure that some peopl will argu becaus it such an emot issu but what were try to do is to preserv what is avail now most insur plan within pregnanc relat servic offer abort if it medic necessari or appropri as a decis between a doctor and a patient we dont want to add or <unk> to that basic offer that is avail now but we do want to do someth els which we think is veri import and that is as part of the comprehens benefit packag have an increas in access to famili plan let try to prevent the situat that might lead to an abort let try to get more women to make good decis earli by get them to see their obstetrician or gynecologist or their primari care physician of anoth special so that thei can perhap begin to make good decis that will prevent the situat from have to aris more govern is thi a lot more govern number not a lot number can govern handl thi well i believ so becaus what we want govern to do is to set out the framework to sai what ar the guarante benefit everi american is entitl to and then get out of the wai we want thi to be a state run program we want local commun to decid what ar the best health plan and for those health plan to compet for your busi and mine there doe have to be some govern there a lot of monei that the govern will put up that thei alreadi ar through medicaid and medicar but we dont want it to be a govern run program we want it to come out of the privat sector we want to preserv what work in the american health care system and then fix what wrong you accept that kidnei can be a diseas and heart can be a diseas do you accept philosoph and practic that depress is a diseas absolut therefor should peopl be entitl to their prozac as thei ar entitl to their antibiot ye and we make a veri veri import start in secur that by put in mental health benefit in the guarante benefit packag and by begin to treat seriou mental ill in the same wai we treat seriou physic ill and through a prescript drug benefit to provid for support for medic like prozac just as we would for insulin or penicillin or some other medic so psychiatrist will be a big part of thi well mental health will be a big part of it psychiatrist and psychologist social worker other who treat both the most seriou clinic diseas and the kind of more mild form that can interfer with peopl function and can have physic consequ how about the fring how about the chiropractor you know right now what we want is what is in exist and most health plan most insur polici around the countri cover chiropract cover <unk> cover <unk> cover the other alli health profession and we anticip that will continu back with more of hillari clinton on our premier edit of larri king weekend next week sly stallon and bruce willi howr we do so far dont go awai mr

next well that will probabl be out befor we finish health care the presid been work veri hard on that with some veri good help i care veri deepli about public educ which is someth that i work on for a long time in arkansa and im realli commit to do someth about violenc in thi societi i just cant stand it ani more i cannot bear to pick up anoth newspap and read about anoth babi shot what do you make of thi i think it is a sick sick symptom that we ar out of control at so mani level of our societi adult ar not watch out for and take care of children teenag dont have adequ adult supervis and disciplin and the right combin of love and attent we dont have adequ polic on our street in mani of our commun we have too mani gun and too mani assault weapon in the hand of irrespons young peopl who have no busi be anywher near a gun you can just go down the list and i think that it go to take a concert effort to break thi cycl of violenc and that violenc ha been bred by depend by drug by the kind of irrespons that weve allow to go uncheck and also i would add by the media i mean i think there is how i think there is a role that the media ha plai in <unk> violenc in give too much credenc to the kind of overli impuls and aggress solv of problem and realli too much on t v that our children watch for too mani hour that seem to suggest that violenc is an answer you agre then with senat simon and hi effort to get the network to chang ye he said the other dai if thei dont chang then the govern go to have to do someth to make them chang well i hope we dont get to that but i think parent need to exercis more respons you know thei need to turn off by turn off turn off that televis set and i know it hard for a lot of parent who work two parent famili singl parent famili but we have got to save our children from be just awash in violenc what do you make of thi the citi you now live in it break my heart i mean anyon who come to washington know what a beauti citi thi is i mean i think it on of the premier citi in the world but to think that here at the seat of our govern just block from where we sit children ar shot in drive by shoot peopl cant ventur out of their hous thei live behind ten <unk> on their door is an outrag i mean we have undermin the basic freedom and right to liberti of liter million of peopl by refus or fail to deal with the violenc that stalk our citi from the wai you seem and appear on thi it look like that go to be next well i dont hillari clinton on violenc but thi is a realli oh but larri thi is an issu that i think everi mother and father and everi citizen feel in their soul weve just gone too far but your go to have philosoph argument here too sure there go to be a side that sai put em all awai and anoth side that sai well there a reason for everi crime ever commit and there a fault somewher well both ar right i mean some should be put awai and never let out i mean there is unfortun some segment of our popul that for whatev combin of reason ar antisoci and ar not fit to be among us but there ar other thing we can do weve seen some thing that work you know if you start with young peopl to give them some sens of direct you can see result you know my husband is a big support of boot camp where we take offend at a young ag and put them into the situat where thei have disciplin and structur and role model we need more adult to take on the respons of serv as role model we need more men to work with the boi in our citi violenc also relat to health right ye ye how much of health care is emerg room fridai night you ar absolut right and weve been try to calcul that and it is in the billion both in term of the gunshot wound that come in and then the linger cost of have to take care of peopl so do you think you might center on someth so that in nineteen nineti five hillari clinton might becom identifi with attack violenc in america well it someth i sure would consid becaus i dont see how we can go on at the rate were go you know murder is now the lead caus of death for some segment of our popul young men between certain ag and that is just outrag and i dont know how much longer were go to live with thi without put our foot down collect and sai enough is enough back with more it go so fast were almost out of time but weve got some more thing to talk to hillari clinton about and well do that right after thi we ar in the first ladi room kind of here jacki kennedi over there that right and ladi bird right got pat nixon and eleanor roosevelt now eleanor roosevelt is over there and youv been most compar to her first is that a compliment oh well to me it an honor i dont know that i deserv it i think she on of the great women of american histori read a lot about her interview her onc did you realli ye i did oh am i jealou i wa twenti three year old oh larri o k and here what she said and im go to ask you to comment becaus i rememb it veri well she alwai felt that franklin as she call him deserv her opinion and had to hear it whether she carri the dai or not when she disagre he should hear it doe hillari clinton feel the same i agre with that i think that there ar mani thing i dont have an opinion about that my husband deal with everi dai but there ar some thing i have a strong opinion about and if he ask me or if i feel veri strongli about it like most wive that i know i will share it with him that doesnt mean he alwai doe what i believ or what my opinion is but we have a wonder relationship go back to our dai in law school where we realli like to talk with each other and over the year weve influenc each other so much by trade opinion and sai well why do you believ thi and how did you get to that point of view eleanor went so far as to write a column ye my dai my dai would hillari write a column if anybodi ask me to i might i dont know iv never consid that but i have read her column she wrote a weekli column ye she did sometim disagre with the administr would you do that publicli i dont know id have to think about that i think that it is highli unlik in my case given what my husband and i believ togeth that there would be an occas where i would do that we realli have so few disagr now sometim we start off at on place and end up somewher differ but i would be reluct to put into print my disagr becaus our discuss ar evolv and where i wa on dai mai not be where i am the next dai becaus i learn a lot from him but you still might want to write about other thing some dai what hillari clinton think i mean eleanor roosevelt felt that she wa a part of the structur she absolut wa right then we seem to go back into other wave of first ladi do you think you have chang the pattern do you think were go into <unk> larri i dont think there should be a pattern i realli think each individu ought to be free to do what she think is best for herself and her husband and her countri i have a lot of respect for all the women whove been in thi posit and i think everi on of them ha made a signific contribut it aint easi but thei mai have done it in a differ wai and i dont think that everybodi should be like eleanor roosevelt or everybodi should be like me everybodi should be permit to be who thei ar so in other word becaus <unk> truman wouldnt have chair a health program doesnt mean she wasnt veri import to harri truman absolut and therefor import to us you know if you read that wonder truman biographi by mccullough or ani of the other work about truman it is clear that mr truman had an enorm influenc on her husband and therefor on the countri iv read that thei often would spend most night go over hi work and hed be ask her opinion but she did not choos to displai that publicli the wai she felt most comfort make her contribut wa privat with her husband so to you that doesnt make her less a first ladi absolut not just differ and that my whole point and it not just about first ladi it about women in gener we ought to be permit to make the choic that ar right for us back with our remain moment with hillari clinton on thi premier edit of larri king weekend right after thi when two peopl have thi public a life and there is no more public an arena what doe it do to or for a marriag you know it been realli posit for us mayb becaus we actual get to spend more time with each other becaus he work than when he wa governor he work just down the hall and come home for dinner i mean realli when he wa governor he travel a lot and he wa gone a lot and you work where you live we work where we live we get to spend time with each other iv realli felt veri posit about what it done for us as a famili you know mayb in some respect becaus there so much public attent you know your famili becom even more import and we valu the time we spend togeth and try to steal as much of that for ourselv as possibl what ar the clinton plan for christma we go crazi about christma i mean we decor everyth that doesnt move and we have a big famili gather and a big famili meal and well probabl spend our first christma here in the white hous look forward to turn that light on on the tree ye i am although im told i have to do it from a great big crane ye in a

194,465,presid clinton simultan promis a build up in and a pull out from somalia thi is c n n and compani with mari tillotson thank for be with us presid clinton went on televis yesterdai try to quiet voic call for an immedi u s withdraw from somalia mr clinton promis almost all u s g is will leav somalia within six month but in the meantim he said he send anoth five thousand three hundr troop to africa doubl the u s forc alreadi there here to talk about somalia and other new of the week ar republican comment maureen reagan democrat consult ann lewi and julia malon who cover the white hous for cox newspap glad all of you could be with us thi fridai we want to let the peopl listen out there know that attornei gener janet reno is expect within a few minut to talk about the report on her and the f b is perform dure the waco stand off against the branch davidian compound back in april when the attornei gener begin to speak we will stop and take a listen but first were go to talk about somalia and mr clinton speech yesterdai afternoon to ann did the presid defin a vital strateg u s interest that call for doubl the u s forc in somalia i think he did i think the presid said veri clearli on what have we been do there thi ha been a humanitarian mission that had to be deliv with secur you know when presid bush with bipartisan support sent twenti eight thousand american troop into somalia it wa a life save mission but we didnt just drop soup kitchen we need to stabil the situat so food could be deliv that wa the mission then that ha been the mission now and it import to note that in the last eight month under presid clinton the number of american troop have gone down to under five thousand now what is the vital u s interest i would suggest it is three fold as the presid said first in thi post cold war world what side ar we on it import to send the signal we ar on the side of human aspir on the side of save live of work with peopl so second it is in our vital nation interest to have a world creat a world in which life save and peac keep capac forc can do their work that veri import and that what were try to encourag and third and thi is recent in the last month but there is now a new interest it is equal import to send the messag loud and clear that you cannot revers unit state polici overnight by target or kill on soldier becaus if we ever did that we would be put a big target sign on u s forc around the world i think we have to make clear we knew what we were do there we ar in there for a finit period as the presid said but we will turn and run overnight chang everyth overnight becaus of on hostil action but to maureen doe not stabil the situat in mogadishu mean the u s is assum a polit and militari role there well i think so and though i agre with ann hi ann on all of what she said i think that there is a certain punit end of thi too and that is to make sure that the world understand that you cannot attack the unit state and thi wa not an attack against the u n it wa an attack against the unit state and there no doubt about that it seem to me that we can take a punit action and spend our six month veri well if we will onc again return to do what the unit state doe best and that is be abl to move tremend amount of men and materi and to make someth out of noth mogadishu ha becom sort of the center of thi becaus there a port and an airport such as thei ar but you look at that countri it all coastlin why dont we creat a new entiti some place els in the countri where those solid forc who ar try to rebuild the countri can then isol aidid into hi south mogadishu enclav and still be abl to move thing in and out of the countri and creat a whole new countri and that someth that we could do in the next six month and it would give us a true purpos and at the end of it when we left and left it to other to fill in the gap behind us it would make a great deal more sens to julia and it good to have you with us even if it onli at the end of the camera what assur is there that the u s and slash or other u n forc in somalia ar go to be abl to accomplish in the next six month what thei have fail to accomplish in the last ten month which is creat the sort of stabil mr clinton sai he want there well of cours what your sai is exactli right and it point to the veri problem with the whole clinton polici and befor that the bush polici unfortun what the presid said yesterdai doe not clarifi what the unit state mission realli is there nor do i think it ha convinc the american public that we have a nation vital interest there and the question now is is what differ doe it make send doubl the troop which is basic what he do in that area and when thei know the oppon mr aidid and hi <unk> know that come march thirti first we ar out of there i think it a big question i dont think that thi mission wa veri carefulli defin at the outset and no question there ha been what i call mission creep along the wai it ha chang from simpli feed poor peopl that were starv to someth call nation build and i dont think the presid or the unit nation ha clearli defin exactli how thi can be accomplish and i dont know how ad these mani troop these ar fight men how thi is go to make that much differ go ahead ann well just can i sai for a moment that no in fact i never heard bill clinton he not talk about nation build and i think sometim as american well what doe he mean by secur though ann and why is he secur what doe he mean by that if not lead to some sort of reconcili among the somali themselv i think again as we have learn in the past we can establish a secur enough system that two thing happen peopl continu to be fed and let us not forget we can as american take pride in the fact that hundr of thousand of live have been save becaus thi countri wa big enough strong enough and human enough to reach out and we have establish and must continu to establish in a period of transit the secur that keep that feed possibl there but isnt aidid the <unk> in the secur arrang isnt the secur problem aidid and so how do you secur mogadishu without take on aidid and if you take on aidid arent you involv yourself in a i would sai that where the polici failur it seem to me the on thing that strike me is that the unit state and all the other intellig agenc have been unabl to find gener aidid well as i recal c n n did now the last time i look the c n n budget wa consider below that of sever combin intellig agenc i think perhap at the end of thi we might consid a swap and see what it would take if we could sort of revers cours weve got a veri small group of peopl here who have been caus a great deal of grief and pain and we ought to be abl i would hope to be a littl more surgic about solv that without rebuild or think we have to rebuild the entir nation and i think thi just but the thing is that everybodi who ha been there sai that the rest of the countri is the tribal elder ar come togeth and thei ar rebuild the infrastructur of their countri it is onli in thi enclav in south mogadishu where there is a problem now if we us thi six month to isol aidid and to creat the abil for the rest of thi countri to get it act togeth thei will be abl to take care of aidid in the long run and thi give us a true purpos from which we can then extric ourselv i think that thi point though to assum thi is success or not success it point to the whole problem that the presid ha in thi post cold war time i dont think he settl on a polici and what now he would like to do he ha said is send in twenti five thousand troop to bosnia and i dont believ that that go to happen soon becaus of the concern that ha been rais after thi issu and the american public ar thei go to accept the idea of have american in anoth part of the world where there even more armament than the like of aidid had again i just want to be care ann im sorri to interrupt weve got to take a break but weve got lot to talk about,

199,483,welcom back there ar onli about three hundr kid who go to hempstead high school in texa onli about fifteen girl on the cheerlead squad for the <unk> hempstead <unk> footbal team but four of those fifteen cheerlead got pregnant and got kick off the cheerlead squad on of the pregnant girl had an abort she now permit to cheer again no on in hempstead texa claim these ar four immacul <unk> but no boi have been name or penal for <unk> the girl to cynthia what do you make of thi cautionari tale what the caution here well the caution is that teenag ar sexual activ at younger and younger ag all over the countri i hope we dont draw a lesson from thi that there is someth bad in the water in hempstead or that hempstead parent ar particularli bad or that kid in hempstead ar particularli bad hempstead is a microcosm of the nation and when it happen in a town as small as hempstead it ought to speak to parent and teacher all over the countri that weve got to come out of our denial about sexual activ among teen mani teen ar now sexual activ and weve got to teach them we have to teach them both abstin and us contracept i dont think thi is an either slash or proposit weve got to teach them both but it mai be contradictori as a proposit well i dont think it is at all i dont think it contradictori well i think that what our moral dilemma is i think all the cultur messag come to the children is that everyth is o k what we have to realli worri about ar the children that ar come into the world to young girl babi have babi as jess jackson put it weve got to sai that wrong it wrong to have sexual intercours with a boi who will not take respons who will not be a father it wrong to be a prematur mother i think that weve got to chang the messag talk about what right and wrong to be a cheerlead is an honor you should be exemplari not onli by the abil to <unk> and be popular but also but suzann charact and good conduct isnt it so hard to know where to draw the line you know we can rememb when girl got kick out of school if thei got pregnant the boi never did and so now we have societi think that wa punit toward on of the two peopl involv and hard to decid how to be sympathet and discourag thi weve got to put the bench the boi too on of the rumor is that on of the father is a footbal player if that were state by on of the girl then bench the footbal player let bring honor charact respons conduct back to young peopl in role of leadership yeah it easi to talk about all of those you know high mind word and yet it veri hard to demonstr to a lot of teenag todai that there is valu in not have a pregnanc that earli in life but eleanor why todai and not twenti year ago mani of these young girl believ that if you have a babi it some sort of a trophi i mean the cultur ha chang among young peopl and thei dont realli understand how their live will be <unk> i dont mind that theyr not allow to be cheerlead i dont think necessarili that the school should be celebr the pregnanc but i commend the school for keep the girl there and as for the young woman who had the abort she allow to <unk> but i understand she afraid she go to get boo boo by some parent who feel that thi send the wrong messag that you should go on and have a babi and so i think the messag is realiti if you go ahead and have an abort you can continu with your life and we need to face realiti more in deal with teenag why do we throw up our hand and sai we cant do anyth i didnt throw up my hand well suzann we havent tri to do anyth i mean we have to be a lot more realist about the messag teenag ar get from popular cultur it veri well to sai teenag shouldnt have sex but the messag theyr constantli get from popular cultur suggest that chastiti is not cool that sex is o k and it also true that were still send those messag especi to teenag boi <unk> in teenag boi is still consid an asset we glorifi that so how can you possibl expect teenag to just sai no that a perfectli unrealist attitud well wait a minut it wasnt unrealist twenti or thirti year ago becaus the there wasnt as much sex in the popular cultur twenti or thirti year ago and a lot of peopl didnt sai no then either thei did go on there were a lot of shotgun marriag that a phrase that you dont hear much todai but you know you didnt have sixti five percent of illegitimaci in the black commun you didnt have increas number of illegitimaci in the white commun the hispan commun what we ar do is bring children into the world with emot and financi deficit we should chang the cultur messag suzann right we dont agre with that exactli were just sai that you need to have a clinic on the school ground that talk about as cynthia put it both abstin and but we all know all of us know sex sell and that why t v doe that and that why movi do that how do you chang that suzann well you can certainli have the author at high school sai that if you ar go to get pregnant and you ar go to <unk> a young teenag you ar not go to be on the footbal squad you ar not go to be on the honor societi you ar not go to be on the cheerlead squad at on time we had great faith in our moral author of adult now we give condom out in the school and the young boi sai to the girl look the school is behind thi what the matter with do it that not the messag of give out condom in school well i think it is the messag is to protect i think it is the messag yourself from the life consequ of a night of sex if your go to do it as mani teenag do and that the realiti that we have to deal with eleanor teenag that like try to banish televis is <unk> sex among teenag you cant do it teenag who cannot rememb to put on their <unk> to turn in their homework ar not go to us these condom that ar thrown at them in the school we have to set firm standard

210,507,when israel and the palestin liber organ sign an autonomi agreement last month the world wonder aloud if these two centuri old mortal enemi could come to term for peac what about some of the other long stand disput around the world could these too be settl in northern ireland the conflict is refer to simpli as the troubl tension between the cathol minor and the protest major go back centuri after hundr of year of on again off again polit accommod fight erupt between protest and cathol in nineteen sixti eight and in the quarter centuri sinc more than three thousand peopl have been kill in fact it been character as the worst ongo conflict in ani western democraci sinc world war two then late last month john hume a member of parliament from northern ireland and gerri adam presid of sinn fein the polit wing of the irish republican armi two of northern ireland most influenti cathol leader who happen to be on opposit end of the polit spectrum had come to an agreement for the groundwork for a peac process mark <unk> report for the irish time of dublin <unk> two and on half year report in northern ireland and he join us now good morn hello there can you tell us exactli what it wa that john hume and gerri adam have agre to well nobodi is quit sure yet thei had talk in secret for about three month befor anybodi found out thei were talk it wa someth like inde the isra p l o talk where nobodi knew thei were go on until thei were at an advanc stage but thei have agre some kind of a joint statement a joint nationalist statement if you like which thei ar now bring to the irish govern and bring to the british govern and seek their approv but realli the detail of it arent known yet but the aim of it is for john hume who repres if you like the major view within cathol nationalist opinion to persuad the minor view which support the i r a that there is an altern polit wai forward so i presum it some kind of statement sai that for the first time nationalist opinion in northern ireland is unit behind a polit program and there is no need to express that polit opinion violent ani more do you have ani idea where thei were abl to find some common ground i mean thi ha been go on for so long and sinn fein ha never realli been a part of the polit process becaus thei refus to renounc violenc how is it that these two could find some common ground i think the root of it mai be a realiz within sinn fein that the violent campaign isnt go anywher you know i r a violenc ha been go on for twenti five year as you said in your introduct over three thousand peopl have been kill dure that time and yet thei ar no nearer todai to their state aim of a unit ireland than thei were twenti five year ago so sinn fein peopl have been sai have been hint at thi kind of thing in public thei have been talk about modifi their aim sai mayb we dont want a unit ireland mayb well agre to have some phase withdraw mayb we would agre if the british govern said well in thirti year time we might want a unit ireland  so basic there have been sign within sinn fein that theyr flexibl that thei mai be look for a wai out of violenc and i think it is that chang mood which ha lead to the optim for these present talk the british govern secretari for the north sir patrick <unk> said last week that he would be will to negoti with the i r a under certain condit on should assum perhap that on of these condit would be the <unk> of violenc ye it interest the british govern ha in fact chang the tone of what it sai rather than what it actual sai for most of the time of the troubl thei have said we wont talk to the i r a or sinn fein becaus theyr involv in violent act now theyr simpli sai the logic corollari of that is that is of cours if thei stop support and be involv in those violent act we would talk to them so by sinn fein presid gerri adam sai that he think of <unk> the i r a from long held articl of faith he could be respond to what the british govern is sai ye i think the long held articl of faith he want to redirect them awai from ar more the simplist belief that we can have a unit ireland tomorrow or next year you know i think theyv realiz that thing arent as simpl as that there is a protest union in thi commun in northern ireland that ha to be persuad of the <unk> of thi thei certainli wont be persuad by a continu of i r a violenc so i think you know peopl like gerri adam ar get more sophist in their polit outlook theyr sai well have to settl for someth less perhap than a unit ireland we can settl for some form of joint author over northern ireland for exampl between you know with the british and irish govern jointli run northern ireland or settl for some other ingeni structur which nobodi ha actual articul yet but you know i think theyr basic re examin the simplist view that we have to have a unit ireland or noth what about ian paislei who lead the democrat unionist he basic want noth to do with anyth that gerri adam or sinn fein would have to propos regardless of what it is how do you convinc someon like him to get involv in the talk sinc now he sai it doesnt matter he not go to talk with gerri adam i dont think someon like him can be convinc i mean doctor paislei repres i think the most strident and most well known voic of <unk> outsid ireland but he still repres veri much a minor i mean two third of unionist vote for the offici unionist parti which is gener regard as more moder and reason than ian <unk> parti which is call the democrat unionist parti so he veri strident and veri vocal he sai hell never talk to sinn fein but he still repres onli a minor within unionist opinion is it just the death toll that seem to be persuad peopl now to start talk or is there someth els go on i mean thi peac ha realli been elus in northern ireland for a veri veri long time why now i think it not so much the death toll i mean three thousand death sound like a lot which of cours it is but over twenti five year with mayb eighti or nineti be kill in ani on year peopl get us to it you know you can live a normal life in northern ireland and not come across ani manifest of the violenc or the troubl at all so it not so much the death toll as the effect on societi youv had sort of a stagnant and divid societi for twenti five year i think it more the realiz on both side that hold on to old long held articl of faith without ani flexibl arent go to get us anywher there is still a lot of pessim you know we have seen polit initi come and go in the past thi on ha rais a certain amount of hope but we could well be talk in two month time about anoth polit initi which had fail you know there a long wai to go yet what do you think ar the main obstacl to thi particular initi the big question is whether the two main nationalist parti those repres by john hume on the on hand and gerri adam on the other can come up with ani propos which ha ani chanc of be accept to unionist i mean becaus that the question you were ask earlier about ian paislei it veri hard to see ani nationalist agenda even if it stop short of a unit ireland which could find accept with ani bodi of unionist opinion i think that is the main obstacl in the long term mark <unk> report for the irish time of dublin thank you veri much o k,

the first year of lyndon johnson nineteen sixti five i didnt know whether id serv two year or ten i certainli didnt imagin id probabl twenti and now almost thirti as thing develop i i think i wa veri fortun to have an opportun to becom a sub committe chairman earli in my second term i wa a sub committe chairman and ten year into my servic i wa a committe chairman that veri rare it had noth to do with my abil particularli becaus of the senior system it realli wa more a matter of how mani peopl on the committe i serv on retir or ran for other offic or left the congress for on reason or anoth hold it hold it hold it ye arent you be modest no no not realli a second term member of congress and your a chairman of a sub committe well that wa through the indulg of the committe chairman in those dai the committe chairman pretti much decid what sub committe were creat and extinguish on the committe and mr <unk> from texa wa the chairman of the agricultur committe and he decid to creat some new sub committe and appoint me as the chairman of on them but he appoint sub committe chairmen pretti much on the basi of senior let me just give you an exampl of how good fortun is part of thi busi when i came to the eighti ninth congress in nineteen sixti five mmm hmmm there were someth like thirteen or fourteen vacant seat on the hous agricultur committe and there were thirteen or fourteen of us who were newli assign on the democrat side to that committe i think there were a coupl of republican <unk> as well and thei drew them out of the hat and i drew the number two posit you know it probabl account for fifteen year senior at that minut right next to me in senior wa e de la <unk> of texa and now the chairman of the committe as a result partial of that good fortun other thing have to happen you have to work hard you have to have well seiz opportun and all that sort of thing but anywai i had some good fortun and opportun present to me i also ran for some offic such as chairman of the caucu and i wa appoint the whip and i ran for major leader i think at that point at the point that i ran for major leader and becam major leader i thought it wa possibl but i dont mean certain but possibl that somedai i could think about be speaker so you got a whiff of power and you like how it smell well power respons howev you want to sai it but actual as someon ha point out and a number of peopl have power and respons in washington ar a littl more diffus than thei seem to peopl outsid mmm hmmm and particularli in congress you have to work with other so much you have to realli make it a collect a collegi effort veri few peopl can behav as we think thei did in the old dai thei think thi is the wai it go to be and i the speaker sai so and that that and i dont want to hear ani opposit to it you realli have to try to settl disput and arrang for decis by consensu more than by order take us into your psych what make you tick i dont know i that a hard question to answer at least quickli i grew up in a famili where my father wa a prosecut attornei and a judg a senior judg for a long time and i wa taught by my mother and father that public servic wa a high call a veri high call and a tremend respons and so i think it wa kind of natur that i follow the cours of be a lawyer and probabl thought for most of the time that i wa in law school and beyond that my career would probabl take me to a judici branch of govern rather than the congression branch again a lot of thing happen somewhat by accid and when i had an opportun to run for congress and i did person i find it satisfi

222,533,exactli a year ago todai in littl rock at a so call econom summit presid clinton pledg to focu like a laser beam on the economi my guest tonight insist the presid did not sai what he meant nor did he mean what he said join me from our washington studio jack kemp former hous secretari under presid bush and now co chairman of the research group empow america welcom back to moneylin thank you januari nice to be with you let look at the economi we have an economi that in the fourth quarter is grow some place between three and four percent we have interest rate down to where thei were twenti year ago we have unemploy come down job be creat almost on point eight million in the last year trade come through with nafta and it look like g a t t what is wrong with the pictur well nafta is good and despit your previou interview with the c e o g a t t is go to be good for world trade and for the unit state of america and we ar veri bullish on the prospect for emerg market to enjoi the best trade and most liber trade polici but those realli were start with ronald reagan and georg bush and im glad to see that presid clinton is continu it interest rate ar low as you point out not becaus of anyth that the presid ha done or the previou presid other than the fact that alan greenspan ha given us a rather steadi control of the valu of monei and as you point out we have a good bond and the stock market thank in main to alan greenspan and i give the presid credit for support the fed through these difficult time howev we were told in littl rock that the presid wa go to get america move again by reduc tax and regul he talk about invest he talk about entrepreneurship and empower we found out that invest mean govern spend that we were not empow peopl we were empow bureaucraci the uncertainti of health care reform coupl with a terribl high burden on both labor and capit we think mani of us think from empow america is go to dampen an otherwis boister and boom economi so what kind of grade would you give the presid then on what he ha done for the economi if your sai that realli the economi that we have todai is realli a result of what the republican did n i didnt sai that i give alan greenspan high regard and high respect and high mark i give presid reagan and bush and clinton high mark for liber trade but my point is that health care is a mess it expans of bureaucraci is go to place a huge burden on the back of the peopl the men and women who creat job that is the small busi sector of the economi and the higher tax rate the surtax thei took off of luxuri boat be now place on the whole economi we should be lower tax rate on labor and capit not rais them and we should be us real enterpris zone not these littl empower zone that doesnt do anyth for capit format so i dont want to trivial the presid by give him a grade i think that is rather trite but the presid bless hi heart ha done some right thing but in effect but by <unk> on seventh of our economi over nine hundr sixti billion dollar in the health care industri alon or attempt to nation it and try to redistribut wealth to the tax code we think is go to place a terribl burden on the most import sector in the world todai the entrepreneuri capitalist of america and the rest of the world so that where you would empath in order to creat job well you cant creat more employe without creat more employ you cant creat more job without expand enterpris and the spirit of enterpris is the spirit of the entrepreneur and the high tax on capit and ventur capit is realli were creat job but were not creat enough new busi minor men and women have littl access to credit and capit the system is not work in the inner citi and the growth rate that you point out ar onli come of three year of recess so we ought to be grow at six or six point five percent not three or three point five percent so what would you do cut tax cut the deficit some more well put a lid on spend to be sure but bring down the high cost of capit elimin the capit gain tax elimin it it a doubl taxat if not tripl taxat it should be index at least we should elimin it in the inner citi we should do what senat moynihan want to do roll back the heavi payrol tax on work men and women and their famili we should privat public hous and then i think frankli we need to establish a standard for the conduct of monetari polici while i give alan greenspan high mark i think with gold wai over three hundr fifti which wa the benchmark of keep interest rate low it time now to even mayb snug short term rate in order to give long term stabil to the dollar and make our bond market and stock market even stronger you sound like a candid for presid ar you get readi to do that im just an old hud secretari ill talk about nineteen nineti six some time in nineteen nineti five right now im get readi to help elect more men and women to the u s congress who can prevent social medicin who can prevent redistribut wealth to the tax code and who understand privat enterpris privat market and entrepreneuri capit on that note we have to end thi interview thank you veri much jack kemp thank you still ahead on moneylin it no sing telegram but it close well tell you what it is next,

226,540,chang and challeng in the u s militari bobbi inman is slate to replac le aspin as defens secretari aspin wa a career politician respect for hi hard work and dedic as a congressman and as secretari but problem exist there obvious inman ha experi in the militari and busi world known for a keen intellect and an outspoken demeanor well join us to discuss thi transit former nation secur advis brent <unk> hous speaker thoma folei and from capitol hill senat william cohen a member of the arm servic committe that will consid inman nomin gentlemen welcom to all of you well todai listen to bobbi inman on the white hous in the rose garden there on wonder who wa hire whom mr inman said that he did not seek the job he didnt want the job and he let us know that he didnt vote for presid clinton and he said he had to reach a level of comfort befor he accept thi gener <unk> is thi an unusu thing for a man to sai when take a job from a presid of the unit state it is unusu but i think on of on of the real question involv in thi is whether or not admir inman think is along the same wavelength as that of the administr if it isnt you know there ar problem right at the outset and i think that what he wa try to sai well why throw the gauntlet down like thi to presid clinton why so public much of thi is the wai bobbi inman is made but why so publicli do that i think mayb the other is to establish some run room for himself and he ha a you know he alreadi been select and so to demonstr that he is an independ forc it mayb give him a littl leverag doe it troubl you speaker folei not particularli i think the presid obvious ha to have confid in inman and wouldnt have appoint him admir inman ha experi as weve said earlier in the program experi as a highli respect public offici both former admir and on who held import post in republican administr so you know he bring a kind of bipartisanship to the post that i think probabl the administr thought would be somewhat us and he mai just be emphas that a littl bit with hi comment todai senat cohen earlier todai senat dole said that it mai not be the man but the mission that a problem here and he point out that the presid budget cut instead of be sixti billion dollar have move to on hundr twenti seven billion dollar and just mai not be abl to do all the thing that need to be done regardless of who secretari of defens isnt that be a littl harsh no i think it be quit realist i think what senat dole is sai basic is look you cant continu to be cut the budget while weve got increas mission if you look across the map you can see that while the threat of the former soviet union is no longer certainli as great nonetheless we dont have peac we have less peac and so i think that senat dole is point out what admir inman in hi own fashion wa sai is that look im not sure that im complet comfort here but ill let you know that we need to have a strong militari to contend with a veri unstabl and danger world so i think that senat dole wa sai just the right thing well i think everybodi agre we have to have a strong militari i dont know anybodi that suggest anyth els there will be some debat about the level of the budget but that inevit in a time when everyon think that there ha to be some adjust done within defens spend the question is how much let me throw thi question out to all of you fundament do you expect thi new secretari of defens to chart a differ cours or argu a differ argument than le aspin well can i just offer on thing you were ask about why would he make these public statement i think it becaus the militari ha had it question about the leadership come from the white hous and that is obvious the situat when le aspin wa forc to deal with the top issu of last year gai in the militari got off on a veri rough start and i think there been a question from bosnia to somalia to haiti and now in north korea theyr not quit sure what the mission is or what the oblig of the unit state is go to be and i think that bobbi inman is sai that he go to speak with a veri strong voic and he ha a lot of card to plai in thi regard so i think the im not sure the mission ar go to be chang but i think that he is go to set a cours which the militari at least and our alli and adversari will be sure that go to be coher and consist strong comment from the white hous inde todai well i think on of the last issu that secretari aspin took on wa that of the fifti billion dollar in addit budget deficit over the next five year and i think secretari aspin said i dont want to presid over a hollow militari and he left with that the last thing on the tabl from the secretari of defens you think there a hollow militari now no but fifti billion dollar of addit cut could go a long wai toward creat on now it seem to me that admir inman is virtual oblig to take up the <unk> where aspin left them on thi issu gentlemen we have testimoni from admir inman on the hill over the year close and open testimoni that have given some indic as to what he is all about we have a piec of tape here from some time ago where he wa speak in testimoni about covert oper roll that tape and then id like to discuss that you have to find somebodi els to make the case for covert oper im i dont happen to be a fan simpli becaus i dont believ the ultim track record of success is nearli as strong as a lot of those who practic it would have us believ senat cohen is thi a secretari of defens sai he doesnt believ in covert oper no i dont think he sai that i think that admir inman ha alwai had the held the posit that covert oper ought to be us veri select and not as wa envis dure the initi year under bill casei as be us on a fairli regular basi i think he wa much more cautiou as he point out in hi statement you tend to learn about the failur of covert oper rare the success and the success arent that frequent so you have to cautiou and select and i think that he would urg the same thing as secretari of defens so that not hi advocaci posit speaker folei there is anoth issu out there and well come back to senat cohen on thi becaus it obvious affect directli on the confirm process there some question of admir inman connect to a man by the name of jame gearan who is do time right now for arm deal with south africa and defraud the compani hi privat compani of on point four billion dollar a compani on which admir inman sat on a proxi board now admir inman wrote to a judg urg a shorter sentenc for thi man jame gearan could i interrupt ye go ahead i dont think he urg a shorter sentenc i look at the letter he simpli point out that thi particular individu had in serv as a privat busi man had in fact contribut in intellig to the intellig commun he made no such recommend that im awar of that certainli is how that letter wa taken wasnt that at issu senat i think hi lawyer request a letter a statement of fact as to thi individu activ and obvious hi attornei want a lighter sentenc but i dont believ that admir inman wa advoc that well find out more about that dure hi confirm proceed ar you troubl by hi associ with thi man well im not troubl by hi associ here wa an individu an intern businessman as such who wa voluntarili provid inform to the unit state govern base upon hi travel and i think that as admir inman point out that wa happen on a fairli regular basi until a certain time period when mani businessmen turn awai from volunt that inform so all he wa point out is thi individu voluntarili provid inform that wa of us to the unit state speaker folei do you want to sound off on well thi is go to be examin as the senat sai in the hear but i think there an overwhelm sens of confid in admir inman person integr in hi abil in hi past servic to the unit state and i think that i dont want to be in a posit of talk about what will happen but i would be confid that the senat will confirm him final let us wrap up on unanim perhap unanim well i dont know but but overwhelmingli unanim senat i dont know overwhelmingli thing ar rare unanim but if there a possibl of the unanim vote i think that bobbi inman would receiv it he highli respect by both parti befor we move off of thi altogeth and run out of time here i would like to look back at le aspin there ar question that ar still not answer there some suggest that somalia wa the straw that broke the camel back in the long run at least in retrospect for him do you bui that no i dont how much troubl did it caus well i think it caus some troubl but if you look at what first as le aspin said last week on televis that that wa the worst mistak he made that is not order the tank in but in view of the polici which the administr subsequ follow order the tank in would have been a disast becaus we chang the polici and it wa tarnish by that as he himself admit well i know but it wa a polici confus it wasnt hi decis on of the most unfortun thing about the press coverag follow secretari aspin resign wa the blatant error of mani of the press report that suggest i think <unk> suggest when the fact were clear that le aspin decis not to augment the armor directli led to the loss of life in somalia in the fire fight that occur where eighteen american were kill the offic command the special forc in somalia major gener bill garrison state that that wa not the case state that he took respons for the decis the problem occur when a helicopt wa shot down and the pilot couldnt be extric from the helicopt and the forc were kept there much longer than otherwis would have happen but the armor wasnt even slate to go to mogadishu for those purpos go to road action to keep outer area open so that the suggest that the press ha repeat from time to time that thi wa a mistak which cost american live is a great disservic to public figur who like le aspin who ar not guilti of thi charg and the press should do a much better job in clear awai that kind of charg okai hous speaker thoma folei we thank you for your time former nation secur

227,542,welcom back a teacher is be held for investig of murder in the littl town of chelsea michigan thi morn he accus of kill the school superintend and wound the princip and a teacher of the school at the town high school yesterdai it is a twist on the usual brand of school violenc in which it the kid who commit mayhem a survei put out just thi week by an insur compani met life sai twenti three percent of teacher sai thei have been the target of violenc on or near school properti and student as well sai that thei have a larg percentag eleven percent of actual i want to give you those figur correctli the survei sai twenti three percent of student eleven percent of teacher sai thei have been the target of school violenc on or near school properti to barbara we keep hear that despit peopl grow worri about violent crime the stat show that violent crime is actual down a littl bit is there an increas in school violenc or is our percept wrong is there realli not such an increas i think there is an increas in school violenc and there an increas in fear now when you have student and adult afraid becaus other peopl have gun then you have thi effect where student teacher and our societi feel that thei must also have a gun i mean what we need ar not these kind of increment step like the bradi bill what we need is an all out ban on handgun becaus the kid ar get these gun at home theyr get from their famili theyr get them on the black market and what we as a societi ar sai through our movi through our televis through our preoccup with war hero that violenc is as american as appl pie and we have to chang the cultur ellen i know youv been work on a stori for the <unk> about just thi subject do you see ani easi or quick solut base on the report youv done number absolut not there ar no easi solut becaus there ar just too mani gun afloat i know as a white woman sit here in the chicago tribun tower that in ten minut i could bui an illeg handgun it just too easi im go to interrupt too becaus barbara talk about keep gun out of school lord know i know we all want to but there were hear in atlanta after an incid in on of the school here and there were lot of kid who came in and said you can put up all the metal detector you want and the <unk> and we know we could still walk into school with a weapon you know gun in school is onli a real small percentag of the problem if you look at that task forc report it actual sai that that is a veri small percentag of all the violenc that occur theyr talk about push shove and cheat and stuff like that even steal what were realli talk about is a lack of moral be taught in school these dai that the biggest problem in addit parent arent involv in their school anymor that is naiv that is a fact that what happen in our school teach moral in the school is not go to elimin violenc it not go to make a dent that is a naiv point of view it most certainli is i think it will it absolut naiv no i think your wrong im sorri you ar wrong i think karen is right i think we do have to teach moral in our school we have to teach i hate to sai it it a four letter word but it love that what doctor king wa try to sai we have to teach non violenc in our classroom and if that moral that moral well barbara i dont disagre with the idea that it might help but i also think an argument could be made that by the time a kid get to high school it too late isnt thi the parent function i wasnt think high school i wa think you know start in kindergarten what us to happen thirti year ago is peopl at home learn a littl bit of respect for author respect for disciplin in their home and if thei didnt get it at home peopl at least thought thei were get it in school parent ar disconnect from school these dai thei ar simpli not involv well let talk about on wai to perhap chang that on of the recommend of the task forc here in georgia on school violenc wa to creat a law that would hold parent account for violenc commit by their kid anybodi have an opinion on that unrealist well that frighten me in a wai becaus what happen if you do all you can as a mother and a parent and then your kid go out of control and do someth doe that mean that thei will put the parent in jail or take your properti that what it sound like that make me a littl apprehens me too as a parent i do you could write a lot of stori from there i do everyth i can to teach my boi how to behav like proper young men but im tell you it a struggl it is you know i wouldnt want to be respons on of the thing that struck me in the survei we were talk about the met life survei wa you had twenti three percent of kid sai that thei had been the target of violenc and yet a larg percentag said thei felt rel safe at school mayb thi is a reflect on school bad as it mai be be better than their street in the neighborhood what do you think there no question that insid the school is probabl the safest place in the neighborhood im write a stori about a shoot at a playground here on the west side of chicago and the question is what do we do with our kid in the school do we keep them there do we send them home what do we do insid the school might be safer to the mayhem that on the street but that aint sai much an interest statist iv heard recent is that by the time the averag child reach the ag of eighteen theyv alreadi wit fifteen thousand murder on televis i think thi is <unk> of the problem it not the entir but again there someth parent can do karen thei can cut that machin off absolut a question about thi well that not go ahead barbara that not practic becaus mani of us like myself ar singl mother and were not there were out try to make a live we cannot alwai cut the t v off i mean we need hollywood the media to also be account as well as parent in the rest of the commun and that the onli wai that we can get on top of thi problem i want to run thi past all three of you and leap in anybodi who want to comment on it my sens from have a kid in public

threat to the bush campaign abil to get off the ground in your state well i hope you wont be terribl disappoint if i reject your premis most of the california republican would character themselv as conserv most of them happen to be pro choic but as with ronald reagan that not necessarili a defin issu with them i think that you will find that california republican by and larg will support the presid though some of them as mani of the democrat see in mr perot an altern i think larg becaus thei havent heard him defin himself yet governor the lo angel time poll of yesterdai perot thirti nine percent clinton twenti six percent georg bush twenti five percent analyz that i will analyz it veri quickli and simpli ross perot is a new face he wa not the messeng not the scapegoat in a time of unpreced econom distress he hasnt said anyth yet he hasnt defin himself he <unk> to <unk> sound bite polit but he a master at it but do you can you tell me what he stand for im here to ask you question well but youll have to answer that on not to answer them im go to persist i dont think you can nor do i think anyon els can and for that matter mr perot veri cleverli is take pain to see that no on can he isnt be a candid exactli he not on the ballet in thi state he could have been he certainli had the monei to do so and had the time to do so if he chose to so i think that he is follow a strategi of not reveal hi hand perhap becaus he doesnt know what hi hand is i think the real question for ross perot is whether or not he is content to go down in histori as someon who threw an elect into the hous of repres and elect bill clinton that probabl what would happen that mai be an invit to the democrat to vote for perot governor your head of the bush campaign in your state have you privat assur the bush campaign that thei wont have to sweat abort explod on the floor of the republican convent thi summer in houston have you privat given those assur no of cours i havent becaus im in no posit to do so no on can give them those assur and theyr well awar of that but i would repeat what i said earlier republican not just in thi state which is a pro choic state among republican and democrat but republican all across thi countri who ar pro choic in nineteen eighti and nineteen eighti four vote willingli and happili and enthusiast for ronald reagan not becaus he wa pro life but becaus on balanc thei found him to be a matur season reliabl leader an econom conserv someon who believ in a strong defens in foreign polici someon who gave leadership now thei have the same reason with respect to georg bush and i think that thei will perform in much the same fashion on the subject of abort in california there a controversi new campaign ad by republican bill allen who challeng senat john seymour in the june second primari let take a look at part of that ad the ad goe on to show an abort fetu be remov from the mother womb it also critic democrat dian feinstein who also is run for that same senat seat for her abort right stand governor is thi ad also an attack on your abort stanc i assum it an attack on those who dont necessarili believ in abort but believ that the choic should be that of the mother i think that simpli realiti and i will make a predict to you is thi ad appropri i havent seen the ad so i cant comment but i will make a predict to you the on race in which thi is veri much an issu is that between senat seymour and hi oppon and i predict that senat seymour will win a lop side victori in the republican primari todai a lo angel counti judg rule that the trial of polic offic lawrenc powel would be held in lo angel counti do you have mix emot over that rule no i dont have mix emot i think that it would inappropri for me now that there is a prosecut in progress to make much comment on it whether the defens move for a chang of venu i assum that your question is that your question number i just want to know your reaction to the judg rule that the trial for the polic offic be in lo angel counti and not move to anoth counti well that hi decis and we will obvious live with that decis that is hi to make i think that a fair trial can be had here it difficult in the dai of c n ns expand coverag for anyon to have escap the new and that a tribut to your network and to other new media it were in a time of instant mass commun it veri difficult for peopl unless thei choos to to ignor the new coverag that is avail to them in abund let take your word our be in a time of instant mass commun and shift it to the polit landscap in california indic now that for the first time in your state which pioneer televis campaign candid now instead of go out to the <unk> and talk to peopl in their commun ar spend million of dollar on televis advertis is that good for polit what ar the thought of a man who been a mayor a governor and a senat well it not the first time and it hardli restrict to california it is probabl aggrav in california becaus thi is a nation state of thirti million peopl and you cant reach them all by knock on door have been a local legisl where i did knock on door have been a mayor where i rang <unk> you can reach a certain segment of the popul that wai if your run statewid you could be in public meet from morn until night everi dai of your life and youd reach perhap on percent of the actual vote public so it inevit if your go to carri a messag statewid in a statewid race that you do so with the medium that will reach the peopl that televis it veri expens especi in certain market like lo angel and the bai area ye i think it unfortun that we dont have more person campaign although i will tell you that when i campaign relentlessli on a person schedul run for the unit state senat the second time in nineteen eighti eight that campaign wa larg ignor last quick question how much will the perot phenomenon affect your decis to run for the white hous in nineti six well youv got a doubl premis in there and im not sure i accept either on i have a job i like and on iv alwai want and it mai seem strang and mai suggest certain <unk> but im enjoi it i like it ill probabl seek a second term but even that is not decid and i will definit confer with my wife befor i do so your question is at a minimum prematur and i frankli had never even thought about ross perot affect it ross perot if he were

261,600,the senat deal with a turbul week im rowland evan robert novak and i will take a look at a turbul week in the senat by question the republican leader he is senat robert dole of kansa thi week the senat began an histor debat on the balanc <unk> amend to the constitut with democrat pit against democrat what we ar do to futur gener with thi burden that were give them that realli is taxat without represent not on thin dime in tax doe it rais nor doe it cut on copper penni out of ani program how easi why hadnt i thought of it befor my what a great idea thi is but thi wa overshadow by the exposur of a high level c i a offici spy for the russian as the co author of the russian aid bill last year and somebodi who support foreign aid as a gener proposit i can tell you that i believ that the futur of bipartisan support for foreign aid is clearli in doubt as it relat to russia caught up in the furor wa the nomin of strobe talbott as deputi secretari of state with thirti on vote cast against hi confirm mr talbott wa soft on the former soviet union tout it legitimaci while <unk> thi nation legitimaci were attend an econom confer in boca raton florida senat dole sinc you and mani of the republican talk about suspend aid to the russian how long would you suspend the aid becaus of thi spy incid well i think we made a littl progress with the presid expel at least on russian he should have done <unk> immedi but i think we need to you know reassess our relat with bori yeltsin and with russia i think weve given russia through strobe talbott here too much leewai thei decid what our polici is in bosnia thei decid who can join nato you know my view is we want to support yeltsin but i think we ought to suspend it for a while so theyll understand how seriou thi spy charg is well what do thei have to do to get the aid back if your polici wa follow becaus <unk> the aid wa kick out thei we had ask them to the russian to pull him back voluntarili thei refus do you think their reaction ha been adequ to the amount to the offens number and i think probabl more ought to be expel and i think there ought you know there ar number of our agent there who were execut tri and execut over the year we dont know how mani for certain but i think it a veri seriou breach probabl the most seriou breach in a long long time right in the c i a so it veri veri import and ill tell you the american peopl dont understand why we give aid on the on hand and allow thi to happen on the other thei thought we had a new relationship now unless bori yeltsin didnt know thi wa happen then i think well we just suspend the aid for a while and see what happen it not go to make that much differ but i think it would send at least a strong messag what about the argument that you hear come from moscow and now you hear come from washington that we have a lot of agent in russia were do the same thing we cant realli scream bloodi murder over have that thei had a veri success clone in the c i a well i think mole in the c i a im sorri we mai be a bit naiv ourselv there ar probabl you know i dont know how the c i a how all thi happen and he wasnt discov mayb there someth wrong with our oversight but the point is that he wa on the insid it last over six year who know how mani peopl were involv if thei find on of our o k thei can take whatev action thei want but thi is a seriou case that ought to be dealt with and it ought to be dealt with veri quickli and i would hope that the presid will continu to us not onli mild protest but to try to find out what happen and in the meantim suspend aid i know he doesnt want to he met thi morn met just a dai or two ago at the white hous and thei dont want to cut off aid thei dont want to disrupt relat again i think thi mai be mr <unk> influenc im go to get to mr talbott in a minut but mr leader be specif you said the presid should expel more how mani more oh i dont know how mani more how mani mai have had contact on i think it up to him to make that judgment but your not satisfi with thi well at least it a modest start i think it been call a modest start even it not enough but even then he wait to give the russian a chanc to do it voluntarili so it you know we dont want yeltsin to fail dont misunderstand me but theyv got to understand too that we have some interest and that were go to preserv our interest first now be specif on the aid sir if i mai ask you how long should that suspens last i think it depend on what thei do you know the presid sai well we cant do thi becaus most of the aid is to dismantl all these warhead thei havent dismantl a singl warhead yet so i dont onli about on tenth of that monei ha been spent and not a singl <unk> been dismantl but so you dont have a time frame on spend it i dont have a time frame now on strobe talbott it wa amaz to me and iv been watch thi in washington for forti five fifti year i have never seen anyth like thirti on vote against somebodi for basic a nonpartisan posit like deputi secretari of state what is the matter with strobe talbott is thi just rank partisanship on the part of the republican i dont believ so i dont believ so in fact i think i said in my statement i first thought id vote for him in try to send a messag then i think i thought id vote against him to send a messag that mayb he had enough promot if he should be elev on more time hed be secretari of state and i dont think he might get the vote im not certain thei could shut off a filibust in that event becaus some peopl who vote for hi nomin said oh well if he goe ani higher then well take a look and i think it becaus of hi write hi attitud over the past twenti year he side with the dove all through the cold war he critic ronald reagan and then after you know all these polici paid off get tough build up our defens then he said the dove had been right the last twenti year well specif mr leader would you sai thi wa a shot across bill clinton bow bear the messag do not nomin thi man for secretari of state becaus he wont be confirm i think it ought to be a pretti clear messag i dont know what he ha in mind i understand i wa at the white hous thi past week and thei said it didnt start there there wasnt ani rumor at the white hous about him go up but well theyr all over town well theyr all theyr at least on the hill senat dole you know the senior offici at the state depart feel thi wa pure partisanship realli ye have you heard that from them have thei said that to you number in fact we got <unk> call thei thought thei had about ten vote against him and i must sai i think our polici luncheon mayb stir up anoth fifteen or twenti weve let most of clinton nomine go through mayb we havent fought as hard as we should but we want to send a messag again it on i think on the russian polici too becaus strobe <unk> been alwai the on over all the year be nice to russia be nice to russia be nice to russia well weve been veri nice to russia in fact weve let them in effect veto some of the thing we want to do thi past year and we think it mr <unk> influenc on expand nato for exampl on bosnia on their relationship with the serb so it not partisanship but i hope it sent a strong messag do you think that it is thank to the russian intervent that we dont have american airmen tonight todai fly in harm wai in bosnia that thei have prevent it im not certain it thank to the russian i think thei move in again to give the advantag to the serb and the serb certainli have the advantag you know thei didnt have to turn their gun in thei remov them somewher els thei can us their gun somewher els while the muslim had to turn their in so i think there a close connect obvious between russia and the serb ha been for a long long time but again i dont know when the russian intend to leav what thei intend to do it mai be help in the process i dont know at thi point do you on the question im sorri all right on the question of bosnia secretari christoph is talk about send still if there is a deal made send twenti five thousand american troop or a similar number to bosnia would you support that if it come through to keep the peac to keep the peac would you support that your talk peacekeep peacemak these ar peacekeep right theyr go to peacekeep peac is go to be made well it depend on the peac if we have thi feder you know with croatia and bosnia that might make it you know a more viabl state if that happen it might be but it go to be it pretti we told the prime minist silajdz just a few dai ago that mani of the republican whove been support him even on airstrik lift the arm embargo were a littl queasi about send american troop there even after a peac agreement sign if it on that impos on bosnia well if he come to you mr leader as he said he will for author to send peacekeep troop would the senat and the hous approv of that do you think as of todai what would your not as of todai i think the presid thei would not the presid got to understand he the command in chief and he got to prepar the american peopl and he got to go to the american peopl befor congress will support him yeah but he cant do that without your approv can he or cant he he could but if i were him i wouldnt do it without congress so he wouldnt now there a dirti rumor around town that the russian step into bosnia for mani reason on of which wa to establish their credenti as peacekeep and that thei want that <unk> to us over the whole area of the former soviet union would you approv or should the unit state approv russia be in effect a u n agent for peacekeep in the former soviet union i wouldnt think so and again i think thi again i wouldnt lai it directli at strobe <unk> feet but he talk about some of the you know georgia wherev it might be that mayb that that mayb russia had a right or an interest and should be abl to proce with that but i dont think so you think that yeltsin ha thi in mind that he want i dont know to get us out of hi hair in reestablish the russian empir the empir without commun i know the i dont know that i dont know the answer i dont know what yeltsin ha he ha so mani problem everi dai he got a new on and it seem to me that that the last thing he need to be look at he ha troop now in bosnia so well see what happen on fridai there wa a horribl incid where an isra commit a massacr in a mosqu in the occupi territori heavi on of the heaviest death toll ever do you think that thi is go to serious endang the p l o isra peac negoti no doubt it certainli go to caus a lot of problem but i want to give presid clinton credit here for move veri quickli in invit rabin and arafat to come to washington i think that wa the right thing to do it show what happen when we have u s leadership and that mai prevent it it mai in fact thi tragic incid mai spur peac we dont know yet but it certainli someth that i think the next thing is go to be try to disarm the settler and all that i wa just go to ask you the p l o is demand that the settler be disarm what do you think of that i dont think it go to happen ar you in favor of it im not certain i think the p l o ha commit some atroc too so i think we have to sort of even i think what we need what i would suggest what thi ha done just like what happen februari fifth in sarajevo when you had sixti seven innoc peopl kill it mai spur the effort to get the mideast peac thing done do you think it possibl to have peac there in the west bank with all those settlement left intact senat it go to be veri difficult would you sai that the unit state should lend it weight toward reduc help persuad israel to reduc some of those settlement well i would sai that ye but again that go to be up to presid clinton i think the fact that theyr come to washington go to provid some u s leadership hopefulli some counsel weve got to get bring thi thing to a conclus i dont think it can drag on much longer or your go to have more incid like we had ar you sai that the presid should have taken thi lead month ago and brought those talk right here after the great celebr on the white hous lawn septemb thirteenth i dont want to second guess the presid well no second guess him number i think theyv been make certain overtur there theyv been try to keep it togeth but thi is certainli the right thing to do put it that wai senat dole the debat in the senat on the constitut amend to balanc the budget look like it go to end up in anoth defeat for the constitut amend failur to get the necessari two third major is that your assess it veri close what would you guess but i think what happen here the democrat you know what thei theyr go to offer an altern so everybodi like senat feinstein and senat reid and other can vote for their substitut and vote against the simon craig amend so i think theyv got it work out so that were probabl go to lose do you think there ani chanc that thi is ever go to be pass i mean thi ha been go on for twenti year that i know of and it never get anywher itll pass when the republican take over the senat in nineteen nineti five do you have ani misgiv that senat paul simon democrat of illinoi the sponsor of it is a sponsor of so much addit spend legisl and you sai how do you have a balanc budget well you get more revenu you get more tax i think he wa list as the third highest spender here in some survei last it bother me some in fact what bother me even more i offer an amend to pai for the earthquak we want to help the earthquak victim in california why not pai for it i got forti three vote a lot of the peopl who vote against me ar go to vote for the balanc budget amend so there is a littl i dont suggest senat simon becaus he realli made a commit to do thi but there ar some there who i think ar but it might mean higher tax wont it it could mean higher tax how do you feel about that we dont have the tax limit that on thing that miss in thi we dont have the sixti vote for tax you could still have a tax increas with fifti on vote senat i want to go back for on moment to the overal foreign polici question with thi presid there been a lot of critic of him you have said you said on meet the press two week ago im try to support him do you think that the presid is vulner on the whole post cold war polici toward russia and europ well in my view i think he is and i think your see more republican i dont sai attack but more republican critic you look at north korea you know weve been <unk> around there for a long time thei talk about inspect thei wont let us inspect two site we dont know if thei have the bomb or not were talk about you know more carrot for north korea whether it bosnia whether it the mideast whether it haiti whether it somalia there isnt ani cohes foreign polici what mark do you give the presid a b c d or e on foreign polici ye sir about a c minu havent you been awfulli partisan senat thi year i mean i dont think so when you critic him on foreign polici is that do you have a problem for the imag of the parti take that posit i dont believ so becaus weve been veri support we help the presid on bosnia in fact i support what he said in hi campaign i even went as far as airstrik some of my colleagu dont do that senat helm who wa on your program said i think bob might be make a mistak so i wa out there on a limb support the presid on lift the arm embargo try to help him we help him with somalia we work out a compromis we cant help much in haiti becaus so i think overal foreign polici should be nonpartisan were go to take a break do you have ani recommend to the presid for name a vacanc on the feder reserv board mayb two <unk> on the feder reserv board do you have ani recommend for him well i think blinder is in line for on i hope the other on would be fill with a black or an hispan and there ar some good peopl out there have you got a name well a fellow name bob wilson look pretti good senat we have to take a break and when we come back with the senat minor leader we will have the big question for bob dole the big question for senat dole everybodi sai clinton health reform program as written is finish he sai it all negoti gentlemen all i insist on univers coverag will he get univers coverag well he mai get a goal of univers coverag that would you might meet it if you could save the monei but the wheel ar come off the wagon on the clinton health care plan and ill make a predict i know you make predict on thi program yeah veri much so mandatori allianc ar dead employ mandat ar dead and price control ar dead now those three ar sort of the <unk> of hi whole program and i dont think thei have enough vote even among democrat to pass ani of those three well when you were at the senat at white hous for dinner with the presid and hillari rodham clinton thei ask all the republican there if you would guarante them univers coverag what did you sai we said it would be a goal univers coverag is a goal is that a no that how do you do it well you dont do it by you cant do it if you you dont do it in the bill for the follow year that what your sai it cannot be well we dont do it for sever year we dont do it in ani of our bill until we save the monei you dont go out but clinton want it right awai thei dont have it in hawaii and theyv been try for twenti year thei onli have nineti four percent coverag will that satisfi the presid what you said as a goal i think so you think itll satisfi him i think so what would your date be we dont have a date we have to save the monei first in the republican <unk> befor we reach out and do some of these thing but i think health care some bill will pass thi year it wont look like the clinton bill hell get credit for it that the wai it work quickli we dont have much time senat if you there a rumor around capitol hill there go to be a dole moynihan bill democrat senat pat moynihan chairman of the financ committe true or fals well it true there is a rumor whether or not therel be a bill i dont know we did put togeth social secur in nineteen eighti three which ar you work on it with him not yet but you know we still have a coupl of month o k thank you veri much senat robert dole thank you my partner and i will be back with some comment after these messag you know bob dole is go to hold the presid feet to the fire on thi spy issu he want more soviet diplomat russian diplomat expel from new york and washington in thi countri and he sai stop aid until we get a full explan hell will freez over befor we get that explan from moscow rowli i wa struck by how tough senat dole wa on the new deputi secretari of state strobe talbott he said that the thirti on vote against him for the confirm wa just not partisanship as the state depart sai and he made it clear that he is not go to permit a confirm of talbott for the higher level of secretari of state you know bob he did prais believ it or not bill clinton for invit arafat and rabin to washington to continu these talk after that terribl disast in hebron when sixti seven or whatev it wa seventi palestinian were kill but he did not sai no to my question should we disarm the settler so i think hed like to see them lose their arm the senat wa over at the white hous for dinner with the presid and mr clinton on health care the presid want a commit from him for univers coverag he said well univers coverag someplac down the line senat dole said that will satisfi the presid im not sure it will im robert novak,

264,605,were interrupt thi stori to go live to admir mike boorda command of nato southern forc he speak in napl about todai action over bosnia thi contact wa head south at about two hundr eighti knot the airborn earli warn aircraft <unk> two nato deni flight fighter unit state f sixteen toward the track and you can see thei came up from the south from the vicin of mostar the lead fighter report radar contact and then request permiss to descend to get a visual identif in accord with our procedur and that permiss wa grant the fighter then report visual contact with two aircraft which he identifi as <unk> and then shortli thereaft with four more <unk> who were fly ahead of the two he first saw at oh five three five the nato airborn earli warn aircraft in accord with our procedur issu warn to the violat to land or exit the airspac immedi or be engag no respons wa note by the <unk> aircraft at oh five four two the fighter again warn the <unk> in accord with our procedur and no respons wa note at oh five four three and you can imagin thi wa all happen veri quickli at oh five four three permiss to engag the violat <unk> wa grant and just prior to the engag the flight leader of the nato fighter saw the <unk> make a bomb maneuv and then he saw explos on the ground we have receiv unconfirm and i stress at thi time theyr still unconfirm report from the unit nation forc command in yugoslavia former yugoslavia that facil in thi vicin were allegedli hit by as mani as eight bomb perhap more on of which hit a storag facil and anoth a hospit more inform on thi report will come from the unit nation command when and if thei ar abl to confirm it but it doe appear that what our pilot saw correspond exactli with thi report at oh five four five oh five four five greenwich mean time the lead nato fighter aircraft fire an <unk> on hundr twenti missil and destroi on <unk> at oh five four seven thi same nato fighter fire anoth missil and destroi the second aircraft at oh five four eight the same nato fighter the flight lead of the two that had been <unk> up from the area of mostar fire anoth missil and destroi a third aircraft at thi time two other nato fighter that were oper in the vicin were <unk> in by the nato airborn earli warn aircraft to provid support at oh five five oh again greenwich mean time the leader of the second nato flight fire a missil and down the fourth <unk> at oh five five nine the two remain <unk> exit the airspac over bosnia herzegovina and we did not pursu them we have a short tape from the aircraft which down the first three of four <unk> the first two missil fire that your go to see dont show the impact with the target aircraft as the pilot wa shift from the target that he engag to the next target he wa go to engag hi final shot the third on doe show and you have to look veri close and gener <unk> will point it out to you but it doe show the <unk> that come from the explos could you turn that off for on minut okai turn it off for a minut jim that great thank you okai so the final on youll be abl to see the explos i want to sai in close that our nato pilot have been enforc the no fly zone sinc april of nineteen nineti three and theyv carri out their mission todai in accord with the u n secur council resolut and in strict complianc with our establish procedur we hope that thi will be the final such incid in a tragic war nato will continu to enforc the no fly resolut and we will continu to oper in other mission in support of the unit nation forc who ar work to reach an end to the violenc in thi troubl area so now for the second time if youd pleas start the tape and then after you see thi well take a few question as the admir said thi is the first engag thi happen to be a missil fire of the advanc medium rang air to air missil you see a lot of <unk> on the aircraft head up displai thi happen to be the air speed which is about almost five hundr knot the missil just fire and you cant tell too much of it come off of the rail here o k thi happen to be the second on and as the admir also said you cant see the impact point thi happen to be an a nine heat seek missil infrar missil and if you look close youll be abl to see the impact of the third on right there there it wa right there as the admir said you cant see it veri close those tape as you can imagin all of that took place veri quickli for the pilot and as he wa shoot at on target he came off that went to the other target and so hi goal wa not to produc good pictur but to execut hi mission and get home safe which he did veri well all right well gener <unk> and gener <unk> and i will be happi to take some question and captain mitchel will point out who the question will be o k admir john from the new york time hello john is thi the first time that ani of these <unk> plane have been ever sight over the restrict area ye have been engag we had some report a veri short flight about everi month or so the airfield at banja luka usual ha some <unk> on it and about everi month or so for a long time thei would take the <unk> off the airfield and thei would take airplan out there and run them up and down to do mainten but not fly them we did have a report or two last year that thei had done veri short flight but we didnt see ani of those and thei were never confirm but thi is clearli the first time that we have seen fix wing aircraft fly over bosnia sinc the no fly zone ha been enforc sinc april of nineteen nineti three next question right here admir john moodi from time magazin tom you mention the bomb the appar bomb maneuv which the plane undertook it somewhat hypothet but had the pilot not seen these suppos bomb maneuv would he probabl have gotten the author to engag nonetheless he would have engag nonetheless these were attack aircraft violat the no fly zone and he would have engag them becaus thei were not obei the warn and thei were not leav and then their action clearli show thei werent do that but he would have engag them in ani event o k back here admir <unk> frye b b c i have two short question the first on is just a confirm is thi wa thi the first time that the no fly zone had been violat sinc the enforc in april of last year there have been helicopt violat and we have dealt with those in the approv wai i wont go into our rule of engag weve talk to the war faction about those but thi is the first time weve seen fix wing violat clearli offens aircraft be us here and we react exactli as we told them that we would had such a fix wing violat taken place let sai four month ago would you have shot down the plane as well ye right here franc press can you tell us the number of helicopt violat and also if you have been abl to identifi thi plane youv shot down ar thei bosnian serb or serb right now i cannot tell you who own these aircraft there is certainli a feel but it onli a feel we pick the track up near banja luka and then we <unk> the aircraft to it so on would conclud from that that thei might be bosnian serb but we didnt see the aircraft <unk> close enough to do that we saw the aircraft do someth in violat and so we act as we said we would some local cabl oper will be cut awai for a commerci messag at thi time c n ns live coverag of admir mike <unk> new confer about the aerial dog fight over bosnia todai continu no im sorri i dont have the exact number but it is in the hundr but thei ar all helicopt and thei have been involv in ferri peopl in civilian cloth do some <unk> and weve had report of other thing but noth like what were talk about todai the serb pilot ar safe after the shoot after the fight im sorri could you repeat that i like to know the situat about the enemi the pilot the serb pilot after the fight we did not see ani pilot eject or ani chute in the area that doesnt mean that thei didnt do that it mean that our pilot did not see it ye hi sue <unk> from star and stripe where do you think that we stand now i mean after the ultimatum came and went and noth happen and then just a coupl of dai after we start with see these violat what do you think that sai now well i think these ar realli two differ thing the work that is be done in bosnia hercegovina by the unit nation protect forc the work that we have done in coordin with them for viewer <unk> us follow a local commerci break c n n is bring you live coverag of a new confer from napl by admir mike boorda command of nato southern forc on todai shoot down of four appar bosnian serb plane over bosnia we remind you that for a gener updat of the dai new you can tune to headlin new and we return to our live coverag not to violat again that would be a reason wai to take thi mr <unk> from il <unk> would like to ask thi morn in sarajevo the serb attack with tank that had been kept hidden from the unit nation a violat of the ultimatum what do you intend to do no that not realli true the serb did not attack with tank in sarajevo todai or yesterdai or the dai befor that there wa some tank movement and gener rose did a good job of take control of that and take control of the tank just as he is suppos to do there ha been no fire by serb tank in sarajevo todai that i know of and i dont believ there been ani paul hanson reuter admir i have two brief question the first is can you tell us whether the u s s saratoga ha stop it port call as a result of thi oper and the second question is what would be your messag to ani of the war faction if thei were to consid a respons to the down of these four plane toward u n peacekeep on the ground well let me sai first about saratoga that she been in the mediterranean for a while and we want to get her in port for about four dai were go to make that three dai and she will get underwai to give us some more capabl howev i feel we have plenti of capabl right now it just seem a prudent thing to do and so shortli she will be underwai with respect to what messag would i send to the war faction i think we sent that messag a long time ago violat of the no fly zone like we saw todai will simpli not be toler and if we can engag we will engag and that what we did brian murphi from the associ press ar there plan to send ground forc into the area where the plane were shot down to try to determin exactli who wa fly them the unit nation protect forc is in charg on the ground and even our air oper ar fulli coordin with them i talk to gener <unk> thi morn on thi issu and thei will do as best thei can thei will do the work here to verifi the thing iv told you thei do not have total freedom of movement in that part of the countri mr <unk> from would also like to ask if counter air missil were sent against nato plane from serbian territori or if nato plane were attack by serbian plane would nato consid serbian territori then as an object to be attack in accord with the u n secur council resolut eight hundr sixteen ani aircraft that fly in bosnia herzegovina that ar unauthor and ignor the warn ar in violat and we will follow the procedur beyond that i think it would be improp for me to comment about what nato or the unit nation might or might not do can you give us an updat on the heavi weapon around sarajevo ar thei all under u n control there ar no weapon that we know of that ar not in control either turn in or out of the area around sarajevo there ar some weapon that gener rose is move and get even <unk> control of but i have talk to them and thei believ that process is go veri well we ar provid them with air support and were also provid them with a great deal of airborn reconnaiss to help them solidifi and consolid what theyr do on the ground there have been a lot of report sometim the report dont know what theyr see becaus it a weapon that is disabl perhap or a weapon he doe have under control and of cours the faction themselv put out variou report for their own reason but iv talk to him iv talk to gener <unk> and mr akashi and i think it go veri well there admir two brief question on who gave the actual author for fire in thi particular case and secondli do we know which group have aircraft of thi type at their dispos whether onli the serb or serb and croatian or who might have aircraft of thi type at their dispos ill talk about the first part and becaus gener <unk> came ill let him talk about the second part but let me sai that our rule of engag ar not someth im go to talk about here but we have author command within the nato forc we have veri simpl to us and well thought out rule of engag and thei were follow precis todai about the kind of aircraft in the area ill turn that over to gener <unk> the aircraft the <unk> is locat here at banja luka there ar ten of them and there anoth airfield over here in the krajina that ha some of these aircraft locat there there ar other here in serbia so those ar the entiti that have these aircraft so onli the serb side ha inaud ye admir it not alwai possibl to know what anoth militari person is think but in your estim wa the intrus of air space a test of nato resolv i dont know if it wa a test i think we pass a quiz i hope that there is also a lesson learn when you take a test you get a critiqu at the end and the critiqu here is that you realli ought not to violat the no fly zone admir just to clarifi were your plane engag in ani wai either from the ground or by the <unk> there wa no indic that their aircraft were try to shoot down our aircraft no that the last question okai what i would like to do first of all id like to thank you for come and i know there is a good deal of there ar a good number of peopl here from the italian media and i ask gener <unk> if he would stai and with you in italian perhap answer ani question that you would like to facilit you us that inform thi afternoon and thi even,

266,609,base on inform i have learn sinc file lawsuit i now realiz the memori which aros dure and after the hypnosi ar unreli in fact if i knew at the time i file the lawsuit what i know todai i would have never includ cardin bernardin in it our justic system ha affirm my innoc truth ha prevail live from washington crossfir on the left mike kinslei on the right john sununu tonight memori in the crossfir in new york psychiatrist richard gardner author of true and fals accus of child sex abus and in minneapoli psychologist rene <unk> author of repress memori good even welcom to crossfir last fall a thirti four year old man name steven cook su the cathol church for ten million dollar he said that as a teenag he had been sexual molest by two priest includ the man who is now the archbishop of chicago cardin joseph bernardin yesterdai mr cook withdrew the accus against cardin bernardin he said he now believ hi memori of the incid wa unreli cook memori of be abus by cardin bernardin emerg under hypnosi it is an exampl of what is call repress memori syndrom on of the most controversi issu in psychiatri todai do peopl repress memori of bad childhood experi like sexual abus until those memori ar releas year later by a therapist or ar those so call memori actual fals memori induc by over eager therapist and then promot by greedi lawyer and ar dozen of accus parent child care worker and priest actual innoc victim of a new salem witch hunt john doctor <unk> how mani innoc peopl have had their <unk> ruin or even been wrongli convict by fals memori evok by thi procedur which is veri veri controversi i dont know of ani statist on that do you have ani idea do you have ani gut sens in term of the number of peopl that produc these that these fals memori ar produc in no i realli couldnt sai ar you sai there on number out there there is an associ a foundat put togeth for famili that feel that thei have been wrongli accus and in on year thei have produc seven thousand member to that foundat doe that number strike you as be reason well im familiar with that foundat and of cours fals accus ar a grave concern in ani crime and all the more so in sexual abus or ani crime where there arent wit but fals denial ar veri common and we dont even have a guess of the seven thousand alleg innoc peopl in the center for fals memori <unk> group how mani of those ar fals denial and how mani ar fals accus most of the case iv work with that have includ member of that foundat have in my profession opinion been fals denial rather than fals accus how can you be such an ardent promot of thi techniqu of thi approach without have ani idea of the statist that might be associ with the number of peopl in which thi techniqu <unk> fals accus and some idea of the number of peopl in which those fals accus produc fals charg well i dont believ there been ani studi done on the number of fals accus becaus of the problem that you have distinguish fals accus from fals denial now i do know that linda meyer william did a studi in which she follow girl who had been hospit for sexual trauma in an emerg room thei had been treat there she follow them up some seventeen to twenti year later as adult women from hospit record and approxim on out of three possibl if you want to sai the <unk> taint on out of four had no recollect of that event so we do have a sens of the serious of trauma i do know that the process of uncov memori and of look at what happen is a veri arduou and veri veri pain process for the peopl involv and it is not a singl techniqu that us as a matter of fact i think that perhap on of the problem in thi case is that a singl techniqu wa reli upon how can a gener approach that produc result that you have acknowledg is difficult to distinguish those that ar real from those that ar not how can that possibl be argu as be the basi for ani kind of accus of a formal natur or charg or indict against ani individu i certainli have never encourag ani of my client to make charg or make lawsuit i dont know exactli how much monei wa involv in thi or what thi man motiv were or who hi therapist wa i cannot comment on that i dont do that and most reput therapist do not do thi also im sorri i cant tell to whom who is speak to me right now that wa governor sununu that wa john sununu were go to switch to michael kinslei sorri about that im now i should have identifi myself o k doctor gardner ar you here to sai that there no such thing as repress memori syndrom absolut not peopl forget peopl mai repress what i am sai is that there ar two track it not a question of either slash or sexual abus is widespread sexual abus of children is not a fatal diseas mani women most women who were sexual abus as children grow up most rememb some dont but there is a parallel track here that make the either slash or consider meaningless there is a parallel track of peopl who have never been abus who ar be convinc by <unk> therapist that thei were abus that all their problem ar the result of the sexual abus and that the best wai to heal to us their term is to sooth the alleg perpetr to destroi him to vent rage against him and that track exist the im not familiar with it but i believ you that youv spent some time studi thi ye but most of the peopl who work with childhood abus trauma ar dedic respons peopl who have no more wish to get involv in a lawsuit than the averag american and ar just as skeptic as the averag american there ar thousand of such lawsuit mayb ten of thousand there a lot of child abus im not the onli on in the countri see them it cant be theyr all just come to my offic in new jersei but doctor <unk> no i mean doctor gardner is there a witch hunt go on absolut number well what about doctor <unk> studi do you find it implaus that on out of of the women studi three or four case yeah it mai be true that wasnt my studi that doesnt prove there no witch hunt thei complet forget about it twenti year later that doesnt prove there no witch hunt you can have that studi and still have a parallel witch hunt for peopl who were never abus who ar be convinc that thei ar abus and who ar su their elderli father and grandfath but sure i do think thi cardin you wouldnt sai that it complet illegitim if there is in fact on out of three or four case of proven child abus the victim tend to forget about it complet and doesnt it seem to me that the repress memori syndrom must be rather common and it would suggest that if there ar thousand of case a certain larg percentag of those thousand certainli ar perfectli legitim look even if nineti percent forget that doesnt preclud a parallel track of peopl who ar be talk into believ thei were abus when thei werent no and there a third parallel track those studi dont shed light on the phenomenon im talk about go ahead doctor <unk> doctor <unk> go ahead thank you there a third parallel track that the american public must not forget there a third parallel track that there ar peopl be abus hurt tortur and be told that it didnt happen encourag to forget encourag to never bring it up and some threaten with death i disagre with doctor gardner when he sai child sexual abus is not a fatal diseas iv seen children die or disappear is that true that children can be kill by thi and we cannot even begin to look at the number of suicid and homicid that occur becaus of a background of <unk> violent child abus america know that do you disagre with that doctor gardner let let doctor gardner respond do you disagre with that ar there peopl who ar be purpos pressur into forget these thing i believ that in the sex abus situat it is common for the abus to sai to the child never tell anybodi i did thi to you i mai kill you myself i mai murder you i mai murder the famili and under those circumst some peopl will repress or suppress their memori there no question but that question of what percentag forget whether it on third on tenth or what have you is realli not the issu the issu is is there a parallel track of fals accus of peopl who ar be encourag by their therapist to profess that thei were abus becaus thei think it an explan for all their problem becaus it an opportun for the therapist to make monei off these peopl who ar victim of anoth kind theyr victim theyr <unk> and <unk> peopl and theyr victim of misguid therapist thei exist doctor <unk> im curiou about on thing in the bernardin case at the veri least the applic of the process that you support should be done by somebodi who is well educ well experienc gone through some i assum some <unk> relationship with other that know how to do it and then appli these thing under rel control condit o k but on that point let me ask doctor <unk> in the case of the accus against bishop cardin bernardin the press put in the public domain the fact that the practition had educ from an <unk> institut had virtual no experi and never had ani <unk> process why didnt the advoc of these procedur come out and undermin the credibl of the accus in the public domain instead of wait for it to go thi rout well i did not have ani control over the media if i did there would be a lot of differ thing on the media but i did call someon from a clergi sexual abus link up program when these charg came out and said i wa concern that thi wa a fals accus i wa concern about it i did not know the credenti of the person but credenti dont necessarili mean the person is go to get it right i think all of america know no but a lack of credenti that you can have a d after your name and it doesnt matter yeah id like to sai someth on that go ahead wouldnt you agre that a lack of credenti mean there a high likelihood that theyr get it wrong unfortun there ar peopl with veri good credenti who ar also involv in thi sort of thing right but with regard to cook i wasnt involv in that case but newsweek interview me on it at the time when thi man said that hi he recov a memori under <unk> my first reaction wa he exhibit none of the criteria of the fals accus the idea that memori that ar recov under <unk> ar more like to be reliabl than memori that come from other in other wai is not true and when cook said i learn that such memori ar not necessarili reliabl he is sai someth that veri import there ar peopl who believ thei can go to past live under <unk> some man said weve got to go to a break and when we do come back well ask whether ani of the therapist involv in the fals accus ought to be financi liabl themselv it shatter your world it shatter your soul it shatter your life the alleg ar total untru theyr total fals and i want to reaffirm what i said earlier todai name that i have never abus anyon at ani time at ani place welcom back to crossfir the withdraw of sex abus charg against cardin joseph bernardin ha reignit the debat over techniqu to retriev so call repress memori the practic ha becom the subject of a furiou debat within the psychiatr commun propon like doctor rene <unk> argu that hypnosi and visual can be us to recal forgotten traumat event such as child abus critic like doctor richard gardner of columbia univers disput that long suppress memori can be perfectli recal and warn that the recal techniqu themselv can implant fals memori in a patient mike doctor gardner you acknowledg that some of these repress memori of thing like child abus ar true some ar fals i agre how do you separ the true on from the fals on or do you agre with john that becaus some ar fals we should just disregard all of them no there ar criteria that i have develop over the last decad to help differenti between true and fals accus in thi particular categori on can look at the model of the known trauma of a vietnam veteran for exampl he doesnt have a period of five eight ten year when he ha no memori of it and then suddenli under therapi he rememb it he doesnt have to go into therapi to rememb it so a fals that not true i have a vietnam veteran i cannot imagin who ha been in combat and hasnt been hasnt suffer injuri to the brain i dont see ani i dont know of ani report so what your point doctor gardner is the point that anyon who sai that not true i suddenli rememb someth that happen mani year ago is imagin it or make it up no im sai the memori free hiatu from let sai the time of the trauma a girl sai she wa abus from ag eight to eighteen then she left the home and then from eighteen to thirti two she rememb noth and at thirti two she went into therapi and it help her recal the memori that is more like a fals accus anoth criterion of the fals is a memori that date back to the ag of six month or a year the best studi demonstr well that you cant rememb that far back that not true three year old dont sit around talk about the good old dai when thei were on and two the mind doe not rememb that not true let ask doctor <unk> two exampl he sai you cant rememb anyth that happen under the ag of two and if you claim it happen for year and then you forgot about it for year and then you suddenli rememb it that fals too do you deni that with noth in between with no <unk> no memori in between that doesnt happen with the vast major of peopl all right let doctor <unk> repli is he right about that well there wa a marvel life magazin articl on at three month babi rememb far more than we thought thei did there some veri excel research go on about infant memori and infant trauma memori is someth that realli ha not been scientif studi clinic we have seen instanc where babi seem to rememb toddler who could tell us thing could seem to rememb thing that happen in the past that a veri pioneer area and we dont know veri much about it yet the second thing that not true is that peopl can go through someth and not rememb it and therefor it must be fals becaus my first two survivor with suppress trauma memori were first of all a holocaust survivor and second of all a prison of war the holocaust survivor need <unk> to rememb thei were in the holocaust i dont believ it doctor gardner i dont us <unk> veri often or ani kind thei need therapi and in my book i do suggest that it be veri cautious us or need therapi to rememb thei were in a concentr camp i would like to see such a person who need therapi to rememb thei were in a concentr camp that absurd that absurd well im sorri doctor gardner im glad thei didnt come to see you then becaus i know i didnt believ them either but thei did have the tattoo perhap it wa <unk> what did thei rememb thei did have no memori of be in a concentr camp well i dont want to discuss that person specif case but we certainli have anoth client who ha a letter from a doctor sai she had vener diseas at twelv who ha no memori we have oh that on isol event that kind of thing peopl who have been doctor <unk> let talk a littl bit about the differ let not throw the babi out with the bath water let talk a littl bit about the differ in oblig and respons of certainti ye when you ar develop thi process for peopl who you ar mere treat with therapi and then take thi process to the accus point becaus that where it becom veri controversi ye ye you would agre that there a signific differ in respons in take someth to the accus stage absolut is there a set of guidelin you would appli to make that transit there ar a set of guidelin mine and other <unk> who work with trauma might differ from doctor <unk> guidelin but we certainli do have them and we certainli do need to articul them and get that train out there if such a therapist violat those guidelin and encourag a patient to go to the accus stage shouldnt that therapist be profession liabl and therefor financi liabl for the slander if it is prove that those accus ar fals i would imagin that i dont know the law veri well i would hope that malpractic would cover that i dont think it ever in the therapeut role to encourag someon to go public or make those kind of decis i mean simpli to even be in that arena would be in the bernardin case let rememb that blame the therapist is realli popular right now id like to sai that the <unk> that iv made who have been supposedli push by their therapist a whole lot of them had some of their own issu in come forward peopl that iv work with who have want to come forward have not want to hear my feedback which is that should be avoid for sever year till you know what go on now you doctor <unk> is not typic there ar mani peopl thousand probabl who ar be encourag by their therapist to sue the alleg perpetr probabl such therapist do not invit in the alleg perpetr to get hi or her posit on it theyll take the posit so let me ask you there no point in ask them well that too bad if that doctor gardner is there absolut no circumst in your view as a psychiatrist where it would be us their case is it can be a us part of your therapi to work out these problem if thei realli happen to sue the perpetr i cannot imagin it now is that complet invalid in your view if the perpetr did it the goal is to try to see if there ani relationship to be <unk> what is go to be gain by su depriv thi man of hi pension of hi estat what have you to try to wreak vengeanc on him for someth that happen x number of year ago is not in my mind therapeut perhap there a rare situat not for the offend certainli it not therapeut to anybodi i dont know i to sue someon thirti year later doctor <unk> let me go back to the seven thousand famili that have band togeth some you might argu dont fall in the categori of fals accus but at least thei feel it is i start ask you a question about percentag at the begin do you feel that virtual all of these ar not peopl who have been accus fals i dont know i have seen about twenti five or thirti of those peopl now theyr now up to ten thousand by the wai the figur is an old on famili and each famili consist of mani peopl all i have seen directli serv as far as i can concern ar fals accus by the criteria that iv develop over the last ten year i dont but doctor gardner deni there mai be somebodi who iv got to cut some who ar us the organ for that purpos of cover iv got to cut you both off thank you both doctor doctor gardner doctor <unk> thank you ill put doctor sununu on the couch here in just a moment it all come back to me now your john sununu and mani year ago you well ill tell you later yeah mike it all come back to you on a seriou note i think it a shame that an unreli techniqu like thi on that is still be debat within the profess can be us to creat the realiti of an indict and accus against peopl in the as wa done with cardin bernardin there got to be a better filter i basic agre but there ar some real accus too what do you think of roseann barr she sai she suddenli rememb that both her parent abus her that might explain a lot dont you think in roseann case i thought she might have said all three or four of her parent might have abus her from the left im mike kinslei good line good night for crossfir and from the right im john sununu join us again tomorrow night for anoth edit of

267,612,the economi mai be take a bit of a roller coaster ride and we better be prepar for it for everi good sign it seem come anoth beckon caution take todai for exampl the commerc depart report that the gross domest product regist it biggest jump in ten year seven point five percent an astound rate but balanc that with stock price which continu their tumbl todai and report that exist home sale and construct spend fell as well blame in part on rise interest rate meanwhil price on the manufactur level increas last month fuel inflat fear well join us from new york to help make some sens of the number and what thei mai mean for the nation borrow investor and saver is richard eisenberg assist manag editor at monei magazin good to see you thank you let me start by ask you that bottom line question i suppos is that old inflat geni slither out of the bottl i think there ar some sign that it start to creep back a littl you look at the commod price and theyr begin to inch up a littl such as oh the price for the raw materi but were not see anyth like the inflat that we saw in the late seventi or earli eighti and i dont think that even alan greenspan expect that well see that he just try to nip it in the bud befor it get out of hand thi growth that we saw last quarter some sai it huge and is lead to all these jitter of inflat do you agre with that i think thei contribut to that but i do think that that is a blip and i dont think that were go to see that kind of frenet growth over the next quarter or quarter or next quarter there wa a lot of pent up demand which i think ha been taken into account a lot of peopl were shop for christma weve just come off a period of veri bad weather in mani part of the countri so peopl have been cut back their spend a littl bit all right let cut to what thi mean for real peopl out there some of these number first for the <unk> to purchas car or who ar extend out on credit card debt or who ar refinanc or purchas a home and deal with the mortgag market advic for them is to try and lock in you best interest rate now rather than wait over the next month or two or three becaus it look as though rate ar go to be go higher rather than lower ar you speak of mortgag rate here particularli mortgag rate if your refinanc or bui a first mortgag where ar thei about now well for a thirti year fix it just over seven percent and for an adjust rate mortgag it a littl over four percent and where do you look for them to be go i would expect the thirti year fix rate go up closer to seven point five percent mayb even a littl higher by the end of the year and the arm rate go up to four point five perhap closer to five percent by the end of the year now doe that mean that exist home sale will slow down or ani recoveri in the hous market the price of home will slow becaus of the pressur place on demand by rise interest rate i think that possibl in some place although i think what realli go to happen right now is thi will be creat sort of an urgenc to get into the mortgag market to bui a hous now befor the rate go up so theyll probabl be some good new come for the real estat industri but then i think it will temper off what happen with credit card rate which ar alwai so much higher than prevail interest rate elsewher thei just dont seem to want to fall down thei ar still at about seventeen point five percent for the averag card the advic there is you realli can do much better than that you can get an eight percent credit card for a fee of about thirti five dollar you can pai a twelv percent interest rate and have no annual fee if you shop around you can do much better now presum rise interest rate would effect credit card interest rate right well particularli the on that have variabl rate and that what the trend ha been in the past coupl of year more and more card ar offer lower rate but thei ar peg to rate so that if interest rate go up your will too now you said shop around for low rate credit card how doe someon go about do that well at the risk of be a littl self serv monei magazin ha the best credit card rate in the countri but a lot of local newspap do that too it not that hard to find let me ask you next about investor we mention at the top of thi that some of these statist have led to jitter in the market the stock market been go down steadili now session after session realli where do you see the stock market go is there some sort of big correct out there i would sai that the market look like it mai be take more of a tumbl over the next few month we at monei magazin think that it possibl that the market could go down as much as fifteen percent by the summer over a period of time it clearli anybodi guess what will happen that our predict it just might happen now iv seen other peopl predict that there would be that tumbl in the stock market but thei also sai that after that correct as you call it thei think the bull market will continu and there will be more appreci in the stock market do you see that i think that right and i think certainli over the long term the market is go to be a veri good place to be but i think that right by the end of the year it like that the stock market after go down a littl will probabl head back up becaus there ar a lot of peopl whove been wait to invest but theyv felt the price for stock were too high how about those folk who ar stuck in fix interest rate instrument save account c ds that have been pai two three four percent interest theyr about the onli on who ar go to be happi with rise interest rate becaus theyll be do a littl bit better their c ds will be give them a higher rate of return or if theyr put monei into the bank theyll get a littl bit better yield so i would sai if your go to be put monei into a c d dont go into a long term five year c d yet becaus those rate will be go up in a few month youll get an even better rate so stai short wait and then go long i wa <unk> to ask you about that you sai in a few month over what period of time and where do you see some of these save rate go no on realli know how much the fed is go to rais rate and over what period of time but it look as though theyr go to be do it gradual over the next few month so i would think that over the next few month the rate on a five year c d instead of be five point six percent probabl be closer to five percent so id probabl want to wait until mai or june befor i put monei into on of those c ds richard final here as we wrap up let me ask you to gaze into you crystal ball for a moment and try to tackl the toughest question it a big question on the economi and that is job where the job growth is go to be and whether real wage which have been fall and <unk> in thi countri for a while ar go to start show some growth i dont suspect that were go to see much growth in real wage but i do think that overal the job market is go to continu to improv becaus as consum confid rise more busi will be higher more i think that the kind of hire that theyll be do though will be larg temporari worker or worker whose benefit ar not veri good so while there mai be more job thei wont be as good as thei were a few year ago,
268,613,the fed talk about regul cigarett as a drug and smoker think that a drag thi is c n n and compani with mari tillotson thank for be with us presid clinton ha alreadi propos a huge increas in cigarett tax now the anti tobacco folk in the administr have step up their attack on nicotin suggest it is a drug and mai be subject to govern regul just like other drug here to talk about the latest bad new bombard smoker ar nanci lord who train as a doctor and an attornei she a member of the libertarian parti <unk> <unk> is an attornei for a group call action on smoke and health and susan <unk> is vice presid of the unit smoker associ bet a lot of peopl didnt know there wa on susan were glad all three of you can be with us and a quick question quick answer to the three of you to kick thi show off should the feder govern ban cigarett nanci well it ridicul it not go to stop anyon from smoke and all well do is get black market cigarett toxic poison non filter <unk> we dont believ in ani question of prohibit becaus that ha veri bad legal connot but what we do believ is that it should be control to the same extent as sell gun or sell ani other danger drug or even sell tobacco remedi such as patch and tobacco chew gum ar control susan number cigarett should not be ban at all becaus of cigarett two point six million peopl in thi countri ar emploi <unk> citizen and we do need to look back at our lesson that histori have shown us the lesson of prohibit the lesson of mccarthyism no it should not be ban nanci do you see ani ironi in that joycelyn elder the surgeon gener ha suggest some drug that ar now crimin should be legal and though she ha not said she would ban cigarett she certainli ha suggest that the govern should be tougher on them isnt the threat in both direct pretti much the same a black market exactli and i would recommend the exact same regul as i would when we decid to legal cocain which you do favor let tell everybodi ye ye absolut and pot exactli and that would be an absolut ban on advertis there no excus for the joe camel ad absolut ban on sale to children and local regul as to where it can be sold <unk> you sai you would support some regul and i think if anyth the f d a would probabl look to congress to set some guidelin about the strength of the nicotin and cigarett how far would you have the govern go with regul no more over the counter sale of cigarett number that so we believ that in fact the f d a ha full power to deal with thi at the present moment we would have it no ban but a prescript it should be avail on prescript as for exampl ha alreadi been done in the case of methadon thi would not onli have the advantag of limit or at least control the sale of cigarett but it would also be anoth step in keep them awai from children and young peopl what doctor is go to prescrib them i wa go to ask prescript for what thi is like these peopl that want to put cocain on prescript no ethic respons doctor want the respons of prescrib nicotin or ani other danger drug and why do you want to turn sixti million peopl or more in thi countri into what you want to call addict who have to go out which is now veri legal but susan we ar addict those of us who smoke no we ar not part of what <unk> me is we ar <unk> as if it a revel that cigarett ar addict we ar <unk> you should be veri proud of it <unk> we ar addict and were addict wors than peopl do cocain and heroin that is not true that is not true and peopl who have given up those drug will tell you thei can give up those drug faster than cigarett that is not true a question a question to <unk> if you sai the f d a ha full power right now to regul cigarett isnt the logic conclus can it onli be that if thei have that author thei should be ban those thing you sai write a prescript for them but as nanci sai who would write a prescript for cigarett well to begin with i think alreadi prescript ar written for peopl who ar addict to heroin we have methadon situat we also have but that to get them off a presum wors drug well thi is thi is also to get them off but all theyr do is theyr shift on addict to anoth the other rather ridicul thing is a doctor ha to write a prescript for a nicotin patch or for nicotin chew gum thei dont caus lung cancer <unk> and thi is the thi is the thei dont caus lung cancer there a differ and we all know those thing ar design to <unk> peopl off of the cigarett therapeut purpos the other point is the other point is i think we have to realiz that were deal with cigarett a drug and a danger which is far greater than anyth els crack cocain two thousand death a year ye that right susan your turn four hundr thousand cigarett death a year how mani peopl how mani peopl do you see mug littl old ladi on the street so thei can go out and bui pack of cigarett now you want you want to talk about addict a cigarett smoker find their level that thei want to smoke i go through approxim two pack of cigarett a dai iv been do that for year you tell me that somebodi is go to be satisfi with two line of coke a dai or two hit of crack a dai when theyr addict thei do with thei do with heroin the doctor heroin addict can get their level and stai there cocain addict your right thei tend to go up but the reason peopl arent mug each other over cigarett is that cigarett ar legal exactli if you made them illeg wed be get shot over them too ye now youv just made an excel point why should we do thi why should we make someth legal why should we suddenli turn two point six million peopl who earn legal incom and turn that incom over to a black market susan ill agre with you im just sai let regul it as much as we can becaus the f d a doe technic have the power the wai the f d a ha expand their power to vitamin and food and everyth els there is no legal reason thei cannot regul or ban nicotin it is a drug just like anyth els i want to let but go ahead nanci sorri if we can ban it we can regul it and let put the system in place so that when were readi to stop prohibit ani type of drug becaus the whole thing is nonsens well have system in place that work and that would be absolut ban on sale to children absolut ban on advertis and civil penalti and enhanc penalti for peopl that get in troubl with them i want to let <unk> in veri quickli becaus we all know thi is certainli beyond a legal question a medic question it a polit question too youv got quit a power tobacco lobbi in the unit state is it possibl as iv seen a coupl of peopl theoriz that the administr even hint at the specter of regul or ban cigarett becaus that mai make their veri expens excis tax on cigarett more palat that theyll go to the tobacco lobbi and theyll sai look thi is the worst new thi is what we could do to you so all were go to do is tax a pack of cigarett seventi five cent more well action on smoke and health ha had consider input into presid clinton suggest for health and thi is the on we think is the most import figur of all we have over four hundr thousand peopl dy everi year as a result of cigarett smoke not true and we have fifti thousand non smoker dy everi year not true when were talk about other other when were talk about other death for exampl from gun firearm twenti six thousand so we ar talk where the realli polit figur ar the number of live involv not onli the number of live involv when peopl die but also the year and year of ill and loss of product now susan is veri frustrat susan you want to tell us that cigarett ar good for us right no i dont want to tell you that at all i mean i dont want to sai anyth what is or is not good for an individu i think everybodi is veri individu we ar adult let not underestim our intellig here your talk about advertis advertis doesnt <unk> anybodi to do anyth that thei do not want to to to begin with well and you want to talk about the alleg fifti thousand peopl that die from the environment tobacco smoke i mean that is a fabric of an anti <unk> mind that ha that number ha not been sanction by anybodi not even the e p a it ha been support by by then boi is corpor american wast a lot of monei if ad dont have ani impact on peopl nanci your a doctor you train as a medic doctor can you talk about the public health hazard of cigarett smoke and why if it kill as mani peopl as <unk> sai the feder govern ha not made the same sort of stride toward help peopl get off that addict as thei have toward try to find wai to get peopl off cocain and other drug wait wait mari mari i disagre with your assumpt what ha the feder govern done to get peopl off cocain by make it illeg weve creat thousand hundr of thousand of new addict as dealer push it on the street wed get the same thing with cigarett all thi talk about how bad it is ha no relev to whether or not we should ban it becaus prohibit doesnt work in fact it ha the opposit effect cigarett have been legal fewer peopl smoke those of us who do and <unk> <unk> i also smoke smoke low tar cigarett we smoke less frequent but when you prohibit someth you get it in it most potent and toxic form that why we went from veri weak and mild cocain in the seventi to crack cocain and heroin now in the nineti and the same thing would happen with cigarett if we ban it or tax it to the point that a black market can work which is alreadi well were not suggest it should be ban we ar suggest it should be avail onli on prescript so we ar not suggest prescript there is no reason for prescript for a recreat product the doctor ar to treat diseas if someon is healthi and choos to us a product whether it marijuana tobacco cocain or heroin there is no reason to get a doctor involv all that happen in england when thei had doctor prescrib heroin wa that some uneth doctor got rich hold surgeri in the subwai station but nonetheless you must admit that the heroin problem in britain is noth compar to what it is in the unit state were go to take a break on that point that more cultur were go to take a break on that point nanci i want to pursu with you about whether there is not an emphasi on treatment certainli compar to cigarett i think there is in thi countri well talk about that and about joe camel when we come back stai with us those ar the ad that have some peopl who dont like cigarett bent out of shape joe camel ad and supposedli includ young women camel that appeal to teenag girl susan you sai that ha no impact whatsoev on creat a new market of cigarett smoker for the tobacco industri no it doe not and if children ar so compel by cartoon figur then youd have children tell mom that theyv got to clean with mr clean theyv got to get white cloud bathroom tissu speedi <unk> <unk> is a cartoon charact you dont see kid rush out and bui <unk> <unk> and if children ar so impel by cartoon charact then why arent thei eat spinach becaus of <unk> three time a dai or eat carrot with everi meal becaus of bug bunni i alwai at spinach becaus of <unk> well if these ad have as littl impact as you sai why is the cigarett industri out of shape about ban them thei dont persuad anybodi to smoke right absolut on can also ask why the cigarett industri spend two billion dollar a year in advertis oh i know thei think it doe someth for them dont thei go ahead nanci peopl ar emploi by that i think your make a mistak and a lot of the peopl who ar fight the drug war make the same mistak by sai that the joe camel ad ar o k there a differ between sai we should not ban and regul tobacco and sai the joe camel ad ar o k of cours cartoon charact ar us to promot sale to kid and if you notic the next gener when i wa grow up as a teenag we all smoke marlboro that wa the cool cigarett to smoke and then now the kid twenti twenti five all smoke camel it work thei got a whole gener smoke their brand camel us to be the cigarett your parent smoke and the other rather fright thing i think which ha been recent record in the new england journal of medicin is that thei found nine year old children were abl to identifi joe camel what he stood for to the same extent thei could mickei mous right that true so i think then thi is the problem becaus were have a new gener come up addict and thei also recogn snoopi in <unk> too susan i want to ask you i would have to think much more than ani assault on joe camel or whatev the femal joe camel version is call someth that worri the tobacco industri a great deal more wa ron kessler suggest in a letter thi week david kessler who is with food and drug administr that there is evid that tobacco compani cigarett compani ar in effect doctor cigarett to increas boost the nicotin level so as to keep their custom addict actual it quit the opposit wai around the tobacco manufactur ar reduc the nicotin in tobacco your averag tobacco ha two point five to three point five milligram of nicotin depend on the particular blend iv got some tobacco advertis right here <unk> on point on <unk> <unk> on point two milligram the nicotin is reduc in the manufactur process there it is reduc and then it is restor excus me mai i finish excus me by law thei have to state how much nicotin is in their finish product those ar in the advertis now there ar natur cigarett product that ar out there that ar done by american indian thei ar pure thei pick the leaf thei dry it thei put it in paper those ar much higher in nicotin level becaus tobacco itself ha that nicotin level the cigarett manufactur ar reduc that nicotin level well to get to the point i want to stick with susan just a second <unk> then well let you in to stick the point that i wa try to get at if you have the feder food and drug administr contend that there is evid no matter susan what you sai that the cigarett compani ar boost that addict level of nicotin doesnt that provid a pretti power weapon for peopl who want to go into court with a product liabil suit against cigarett compani well on of the thing that you have to bear in mind here that tobacco is not the onli plant in the <unk> famili youv got eggplant youv got <unk> youv got tomato youv got potato youv got <unk> green you want to do someth about nicotin in on substanc do it with everyth you want to regul nicotin the f d a then youv got to regul the purchas and the person growth of veget in your garden let let <unk> in on thi point you see that letter from the f d a and open up that can of worm as potenti a veri power weapon in product liabil suit against cigarett manufactur i certainli did and as a result of thi organ yet anoth petit we did on seventeen year ago as well to have tobacco declar a drug particularli sinc it is the onli product that can be when it us as direct will caus ill and death now as to thi question of ad nicotin our friend sai quit rightli that the nicotin is taken out it is then restor put in and fortifi nor ar these the onli danger chemic that ar in tobacco recent law case have reveal that pesticid that ar sprai on the tobacco leav and that ar then swept up and recycl and put into the tobacco product also provid a larg number of veri danger chemic so the chemic come from again nobodi is disput that smoke tobacco is veri bad for you and there a lot of bad thing in it oh i thought susan wa i dont think so i dont think she just disput us on the ad i think what were disput is whether the govern can do anyth about it and i think it veri import to note that cigarett have been legal now forev and we have had a substanti reduct in the number of smoker just like weve had a substanti reduct in the number of drinker peopl dont drink as much as thei us to and thei tend to drink light wine govern prohibit and regul increas us and increas the potenc of the product and the same thing will happen in the case of cigarett if thei ar either prohibit or regul to the point that thei becom difficult to get that is correct two main thing i think have been respons but hang on to <unk> just a second were go to take a break you get to sai your two main thing when we come back stai with us when a young person start to us tobacco it is a signal an alarm that he or she mai get involv in other riski behavior welcom back to our last few minut and susan it realli is onli a few minut so pleas you nanci <unk> no <unk> i want to try and squeez all of you in the last few minut susan weve alreadi seen smoker ban in a lot of restaur a lot of public build do you think the feder govern is go to tighten those screw even more given the current debat well you know theyr cut their own throat if thei do if thei want to be abl to fund you know the clinton health care program on excis tax you know what the point it like oh let take awai here and give here but your go to take awai here to do what <unk> where do you see thi debat about new regul of cigarett go i certainli think the f d a will at last take the opportun to classifi tobacco as a drug the onli product which us when direct which caus death and injuri on a vast scale i want to ask veri veri quickli befor we go to nanci who should get a prescript for cigarett and who should write that prescript under your theori <unk> under my theori on would go to a doctor just as on goe for diabet insulin prescript or

with the violenc and harsh recrimin that occur almost daili in south africa it is that turmoil and the extraordinari expect of those long shut out of the polit process that we focu on in a moment a discuss i did a few dai ago with two women who have been integr in the struggl for independ <unk> <unk> the widow of long time a n c leader oliv <unk> and a lead figur in the a n cs women leagu and <unk> <unk> she spent ten year in intern exil for her anti apartheid work and is now deputi vice chancellor of the univers of cape town but first a look at some recent develop in south africa on tuesdai for the first time in nine month south africa two main black rival african nation congress leader nelson mandela and zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi head of the inkatha freedom parti met to discuss the violenc much of which stem from the rivalri of their group thei also talk about the buthelezi decis so far to boycott the elect buthelezi sai he want a separ homeland for the zulu peopl which the agreement work out between mandela and south african presid f w de klerk doe not make room for inkatha ha been <unk> in the boycott by the right wing white <unk> parti rais the specter of more violenc and cast some doubt on the valid on the expect presidenti win for mandela it is for that reason that mandela ha begun to offer accommod to buthelezi join us now mr <unk> <unk> and mr <unk> <unk> we thank you both for be with us mr <unk> what do you think the prospect ar right now for peac elect in south africa in april that do not includ the so call freedom allianc the inkatha parti and the right wing <unk> parti both the inkatha parti and the right wing allianc have said theyr not go to take part in the elect on the twenti seventh of april attempt have been made by presid mandela to get both the allianc and doctor buthelezi to join the elect without ani success howev the elect ar go on on the twenti seventh of april with or without the freedom allianc and doctor buthelezi and what ar the prospect that those elect mr <unk> will be peac elect clearli we ar veri concern about have parti outsid the elect process and the attempt that have been made to try and draw peopl in and even the extent to which peopl have been prepar to call a special parliament is an indic of just how serious peopl take the threat to free and fair elect is some parti stai out of it and i think it veri import also to remind peopl that the role of <unk> is a histor role and we have to make sure that thei do not complet derail the process and i think the chanc of free and fair elect will be heighten by the extent to which the remain parti who ar part of the process act with resolv and disciplin and also the extent to which the independ elector commiss and the other arm such as the peacekeep forc and the south africa defens forc and polic work togeth to ensur as much freedom and fair around the elect process as possibl and i have confid ar you worri about that mr <unk> ye i am worri about it there ha been a lot of violenc in south africa it ha been sad that the violenc wa perpetr by the support of the <unk> the inkatha freedom parti ye and i can see that even though weve got observ even though the unit nation is there even though the oau is there if thei do get a chanc there ar some live that will be lost and far too much blood ha been spill even befor the elect and we would like to minim violenc as much as possibl and mr <unk> is there ani doubt in your mind that nelson mandela is go to be elect presid with full power to run the countri of south africa that he will be elect presid i think there no doubt but i think it import to rememb that unlik mani process of transit our ha been <unk> to usher in a govern of nation uniti so that mr mandela will be there togeth with other parti that get five percent or more in the elect process and that is fundament import becaus the problem of our countri ar too complex for on particular parti to be abl to deal with i think it veri import the current nationalist parti which ha been in govern and ha been part of the problem ha also got to make a contribut to solv the problem that it ha creat over the year assum mr mandela is presid assum all thi happen mr <unk> how much time doe he have to satisfi what have to be rise expect on the part of so mani of your peopl he ha to start straight awai im afraid peopl have been oppress for over three hundr year forti year of which were under the apartheid rule and as soon as mandela came out of jail after spend twenti seven year the peopl ar sai that now mandela is out there go to be a chang in our live and hous job educ ar a prioriti and he ha to deliv someth and the first thing i think is hous and job he hasnt got time it should have been deliv forti year ago and therefor what is realli import is for the intern commun to understand that the deliveri of the <unk> of basic servic which come from that era ha to be a process undertaken not onli by mr mandela govern but by all south african which is why we constantli stress the import of both the government and the non government sector mr <unk> you mention a minut ago the need for foreign invest for capit to continu to flow in to stai in south africa how doe mr mandela how do the peopl around him the new structur ensur that that happen well mr mandela ha been travel all over the world and he ha been encourag peopl all over the world to invest in south africa he wa in the unit state here and he encourag the unit state businessmen to invest in south africa besid the american govern ha promis to help the south african dure thi ordeal and the non government bodi here like ford foundat the kaiser foundat and mani other foundat that ar help us all the time dure the struggl what do you see south africa look like five year from now i think if we get our act togeth and concentr on the develop of the enorm human capit i see south africa becom a model of what reconcili can look like if you tackl not onli polit transit but also socio econom transit issu to make sure that you creat a commun of peopl i think it import for peopl to understand that the current tension and violenc ar not like the problem you have in other part of the globe where there is ethnic embed in it in thi case were have a polit <unk> but differ ethnic group differ peopl of color differ peopl who have been on oppos side oppressor and oppress have sat togeth on the tabl and work out a solut which i believ if it is stabil we can becom a model of what the greater global villag can accomplish do you agre that that can be done ye i do certainli and alreadi peopl ar begin to stream into south africa from the neighbor countri so we have to have a concret govern a viabl economi so that we can help the entir region to flourish and your optimist too im optimist but im not unawar of the danger and im not unawar of the limit resourc and the unlimit need but i think with intern assist and with disciplin on our part we

speaker thi is a sad moment for all of us becaus of the unparallel public servic of mr <unk> he will have in the record of eighteen thousand four hundr on roll call vote a record that i believ will stand forev also the new airport in denver is not work now thi hour new thi is all thing consid im noah adam and im linda wertheim presid clinton said todai that treasuri depart offici and white hous aid should not have met to discuss the statu of the whitewat investig although the presid said he didnt believ there had been ani wrongdo he instruct hi chief of staff mac mclarti to prepar a memo to guard against similar contact in the futur also todai treasuri secretari lloyd bentsen said he ha ask a govern ethic offic to investig the meet bentsen said he did not attend the brief and wa not inform thei were take place presid clinton said it would have been better if the brief had not taken place and such meet will not occur in futur what i want the peopl here to understand is never mind what the rule ar bend over backward to avoid the appear of it let let thi thing go forward there is an investig process the the record ar in hand as far as i know for the investig to do their work let it go forward we dont need to have ani implic that we ar in ani wai try to manag or affect thi process thi is just the latest twist in the veri tangl saga of whitewat whitewat wa the name of the real estat partnership mr and mr clinton form with jame mcdougal hi busi deal includ hi bankrupt save and loan and the clinton connect to them ar now under investig by special counsel robert fisk npr mara liasson join us from the white hous mara what were the meet with feder regul and white hous offici what were thei about well there were two meet and in both of them treasuri depart offici who ar in charg of the r t c the resolut trust corpor that the feder agenc in charg of clean up the mess from all the bankrupt save and loan thei talk with top white hous aid includ the white hous counsel berni nussbaum about the justic depart crimin investig of jame mcdougal save and loan and the fact that presid clinton and mr clinton were name in that crimin referr is there anyth wrong with do that well usual crimin referr ar confidenti and feder regul dont share what in them with anyon other than prosecutor and thei certainli dont share them with the peopl name in the referr mara now thi whole busi which we conveni lump under the name whitewat which wa the name of the properti develop the clinton invest in with their friend the mcdougal the question that have been rais ar more about that relationship with the mcdougal than about the invest question about whether the partnership with then governor clinton what did it mean when the s and l wa in troubl did the clinton do more than wa proper to help their friend did mr mcdougal help the clinton financi through hi bank or through the partnership call whitewat estat right there ar basic three question that <unk> to clinton behavior and what could caus him some problem other than just the embarrass of have done busi with a gui like jim mcdougal on of them is did mcdougal divert taxpay back fund from hi s and l to the whitewat compani or to clinton campaign fund now mcdougal did onc rais about thirti thousand dollar for then governor clinton now and if so did clinton know about it number two did the presid and mr clinton take improp tax deduct now thei claim thei invest quit a bit of monei in whitewat and lost it but so far thei havent been abl to produc evid of that the third potenti problem for clinton is whether he wa guilti of favorit now mr clinton repres mcdougal save and loan befor arkansa state bank regul the same regul who were appoint by her husband and there have been charg that mcdougal receiv special treatment from these bank regul now thi could be influenc peddl or it could just be <unk> and back scratch someth that smell bad to most of us but wa busi as usual in the tight knit world of arkansa polit so is is thi a legal problem or is it a polit problem for the presid do you think well it both right now i think the polit headach ar loom a lot larger than the legal on the wai the white hous ha handl thi whole matter is make the polit problem i think even bigger than thei have to be with everi on of the white hous misstep such as these meet between r t c offici and berni nussbaum the republican on capitol hill get an open and of cours clinton oppon on the hill were on the floor of the hous and senat again todai call for congression investig of whitewat but thi is the kind of thing that realli ha the presid polit advis tear their hair out and the meet were not the first <unk> rememb it took the clinton a veri long time to agre to hand over the document about whitewat to the special counsel and theyv been act all along as if thei have someth to hide and that make peopl feel that thei do why do you think it isnt be handl better and with more dispatch well there ar a lot of explan be offer here at the white hous the presid by the wai is said to have been absolut furiou todai and he ask hi chief of staff mac mclarti to make sure that noth like thi ever happen again but finger ar point and theyr point at the same person that theyv been point at all along berni nussbaum nussbaum is the white hous counsel and iron nussbaum cut hi teeth as a lawyer on the waterg committe where youd think he would have learn that it cover up or the appear of cover up that can get you into a lot of troubl now about the nicest thing some white hous aid ar sai about nussbaum now is that he ha a fundament misunderstand of the counsel job that it not just a legal job it not just to repres the presid as a legal client it to keep the presid out of troubl and there all kind of troubl a presid can get into in washington thank veri much,

to counter tale of sexual harass it a giant polit game between the right wing that is try to stop the presid agenda that all it is and when a former arkansa clerk can potenti derail a presid i would call it sexual harass it mean the rough busi of be presid mai have just becom a littl rougher im not go to <unk> thi by a comment on it tonight the polit of the paula jone affair thi is a b c new nightlin report from washington ted koppel it is spring here in washington and hypocrisi is in full bloom presid clinton polit enemi who can bare contain their glee over the paula jone alleg have discov how deepli commit thei ar to the caus of root out sexual harass mani of the presid support on the other hand who had no troubl at all bridg the gap between alleg and conclus when it came to anita hill charg against clarenc thoma have now becom <unk> to the distinct alleg thei now appear to be sai ar inappropri topic for discuss it is as alwai simpli a question of whose ox is gore we in the media of cours ar guard our sacr turf between the <unk> and the park lot owner we got it we sell it weve still got it scandal make good copi no matter who involv in the meanwhil whatev the merit of ms <unk> alleg the presid and hi defend have to take appropri measur and oh ye he ha to run the execut branch of govern as nightlin correspond chri buri report these thing have a life of their own for conserv republican the sordid spectacl of the clarenc thoma hear left a terribl tast i think that thi todai is a travesti i think that it is disgust after all anita hill alleg of sexual harass first leak by liber democrat nearli derail hi nomin such hardbal polit had alreadi destroi republican john <unk> bid for defens secretari democrat had us stori of drunken and woman against him and it just humili what he did to me but now that paula jone a former arkansa state employe ha accus the presid of onc make unwant sexual advanc conserv ar cry hypocrisi to the mute reaction of feminist and liber what wa the liber spin the liber spin on anita hill why she wa a saint the liber spin on paula jone is that she a bimbo it a giant polit game between the right wing that is try to stop the presid agenda that all it is plain and simpl there no sort of doubt about it it not about hypocrisi it not about anyth it about plai polit how els to explain the i believ paula button on the coat of anita hill bash republican robert dornan how els to explain the cautiou reserv of tradition outspoken feminist group conserv too sai it all about polit becaus if you get the number on radic feminist organ in the countri the nation organ for women sai weve heard her alleg were in a wait and see posit wed have to sai that that is absolut quintessenti hypocrisi thei didnt wait and see with anita why ar thei wait and see with paula were not go to be bait by conserv theyv never been on the side of defend women right theyv attack the whole concept the legal concept of sexual harass repeatedli the new media ha also been accus of hypocrisi accus of buri the paula jone stori he present <unk> to me in a veri unprofession manner and i would call it sexual harass jone made her charg public in februari at the conserv polit action confer but the mainstream media gave the stori such short <unk> conserv activist bought newspap ad to protest not until thi month after the presid hire a heavyweight washington lawyer did paula jone make the front page editor sai her stori rais too mani nag question who is thi woman what ar her motiv how did she handl herself who is she be who is she associ with why did she go to the conserv polit action committe why did she align herself so close with cliff jackson a clinton hate republican in arkansa who would do anyth sai anyth take ani step in order to destroi clinton as the trooper explain it the standard procedur in a case like thi wa for on of them to inform the hotel that the governor need a room for a short time cliff jackson a clinton arch enemi peddl the paula jone stori at a convent attend by some of the same activist who had tri to smear anita hill jone ha also been embrac by the religi right patrick mahonei the nation spokesman for oper rescu is on of her handler and pat <unk> christian broadcast network ha taken up her caus her stori ha the potenti to bring down the clinton presid but the media wont cover it all of that rais the question is the comparison of anita hill and paula jone even a valid on and i think the differ between anita hill and paula jone ar far more profound than ani similar first of all anita hill did not go befor a democrat or a liber sponsor group she wa not a pawn if you will of activist the wai the wai paula jone ha been secondli anita hill work for the person she wa accus paula jone wa veri much in an employ employe situat the governor obvious is the highest offic you can hold in the state we also know that clarenc thoma wa never alleg to have touch anita hill paula jone ha made veri clear the alleg that she wa inde touch by then governor bill clinton the polit of the paula jone case no matter how messi could have seriou consequ for the presid im not go to <unk> thi by a comment on it he start to put hi hand and slide up my leg i push him back i got awai now that a lawsuit ha been file the legal fight promis to be long expens and embarrass onc the motion for dismiss is turn down and i expect it will be turn down the attornei for paula jone have a green light to start ask question relev question about the presid past some of that will go not to thi case but other possibl liaison that mai have been arrang by bodyguard or liaison that occur on government properti or in government vehicl all of that is potenti relev to establish a pattern that is why the presid lawyer eager to get the lawsuit dismiss have suggest jone file it in the hope of gain monei or a job thi suit is about public it about talk show it about monei but how doe a presid of modest mean pai for all that high price legal talent washington attornei robert bennett bill at more than four hundr dollar an hour and the prospect of a legal defens fund for a sit presid rais sticki ethic issu we dont like peopl give monei to a presid we want to know who those peopl ar but if it public knowledg who give monei to the presid then he might feel beholden to them i think that the democrat nation committe ought to pai it becaus it not legal bill it polit bill thi whole thing is driven all by polit plain and simpl on hundr percent no matter who pai such a legal nightmar for the presid could ultim be a polit win for hi enemi and for the white hous that is a genuin fear the paula jone case could accomplish in the court what mr clinton conserv detractor have fail to do in congress put hi agenda on hold thi is chri buri for nightlin in washington and when we come back well be join by presidenti advis mandi grunwald and by conserv polit activist bai buchanan mandi grunwald wa an advis to presid bill clinton when he wa a candid for the presid and is now on of hi top polit and media advis she join us from our new york bureau bai buchanan wa the patrick of wa the manag of brother patrick buchanan presidenti campaign and is now the head of a conserv educ foundat she join us from our washington bureau mandi let me if i mai begin with you what i alwai enjoi about jame carvil is he get right to the point polit pure and simpl but i would sai to you why not it wa polit pure and simpl when clarenc thoma wa sit befor the senat judiciari committe and the democrat and the liber democrat in particular were push it like gangbust not becaus of the merit of the case but becaus it made good polit to do it let me add on more thing to the stori it not just about polit it about cash i think there a fundament differ here between anita hill and paula jone and it about monei whether you believ anita hill or you didnt she never offer to sell her silenc for monei i think that a veri seriou thing paula <unk> lawyer offer her silenc in exchang for monei in exchang for a job for herself for her husband in california she alreadi had figur out how to <unk> up the t v and the movi right with her lawyer on exactli how much monei theyd each make her own sister sai that she smell monei in thi i think thi is a stori about a woman who try to shake down the presid of the unit state i think thi is a veri differ stori yeah but that part of it you as a presidenti advis dont need to worri about what you do need to worri about is that your polit oppon ar go to be abl to make hai out of thi thing just as the polit oppon of clarenc thoma were abl to make hai out of hi well i think that it veri clear what go on here i dont know what ms <unk> motiv ar other than the monei but she obvious ha hook up with everi right wing extremist in thi countri and i dont know if she be manipul by them or who work on who but you obvious have a lot of pat robertson jerri falwel you name them all theyr all in thi theyr all try to destroi the presid and stop hi agenda yeah that someth to reckon with and theyd prefer to talk about paula jone than argu about the economi or health care or ani of the substant issu the presid is try to address let me let me try the same line of question with you bai and that is isnt thi simpli a case of <unk> is fair plai we have we have arriv at a point in thi countri where we set out to win or destroi an oppon in ani wai that we can and if bring along someon like paula jone to make certain alleg is the wai to do it then we do it just as the case wa just as the anita hill clarenc thoma case ted there no question that in polit is an extraordinarili brutal busi iv been in twenti year join it just a week after waterg and ever sinc then weve had casualti and <unk> across the battlefield with peopl attack individu on person ground and it start with nixon i think it went into judg bork and judg thoma we had senat tower we had a number of other on bruce herschensohn just last a coupl of year ago out there in california and it seem to me if you look around that the wound and the casualti ar predominantli republican it the democrat that start thi thei felt it wa fair plai and that chicken got big and fat and is now come home to roost in the democrat camp it a terribl tragedi for america and when mandi sai thi is about monei im afraid it not necessarili just about polit it about charact and that the real problem that we face todai is the charact of the presid of the unit state is charact a legitim issu when on vote in an elect i believ it is i guess the appropri question to ask there bai is if charact wa an appropri question to rais it wa inde rais dure the campaign is it not an appropri issu to set asid until the next campaign it is ted if we ar talk about issu that were air and the american peopl said put it asid but what were talk about here is an alleg clearli just an alleg but an alleg of lewd and inde crimin behavior on the part of the presid of the unit state the presid is never abov the law as is anyon is not in thi nation and so we have to follow it through we should turn it over to the court let them decid which of these two individu is tell the truth and which on is ly and let the court resolv it but it is a it is a terribl statement that we have allow someth like thi these kind of alleg to be allow to run along here and truli the problem here is the presid ha a pattern of these kind of alleg hang around hi neck if thi wa isol ted if it wa somebodi make thi alleg against a jimmi carter none of us would be here tonight talk about it well iv got to sai ted rush limbaugh is the on conserv who been candid about thi whole issu of charact he said on your own show a coupl of week ago that the reason that he and other were try to attack the presid charact wa to stop health care reform i thought that wa the most refresh thing anybodi said becaus instead of all these high hors at least he told the truth these peopl ar try to replai the elect thei dont like the result mandi and thei dont like what is happen mandi let me ask you someth if you look just now you saw again judg thoma hi he the alleg against him wa noth like thi and yet he came out there he recogn the greatest asset he had wa hi reput and someon wa try to steal it it wa with real indign and anger come out of everi <unk> as he stood there befor that senat and said i cant believ thi where is the presid i ask him come out tomorrow and sai i am furiou that someon would sai thi about me it is categor untru and i have ask on of the best attornei in thi countri to make certain my reput is protect i dont see that i see a an attornei sai he didnt do it i dont see the presid i dont see the indign let him sai it and let us all put it to rest and let it be resolv in the court and onli in the court ill tell you what mandi take a coupl of minut to come up with i thank her for thank bai for the media advic though for the presid well to you know save your indign for a coupl of minut and well come back with it well be back in just a moment mandi grunwald on of the on of the thing i think we have here is sort of the polit equival of a tribal blood feud there is a certain i mean here is judg thoma who quit clearli wa traumat by those hear ha bare said a word sinc he ha sat on the suprem court and now there seem to be a sens that the same kind of thing ha to be done to bill clinton well i think thi is part of a pattern not just of these group be concern about thi alleg but all of these extremist group who have been oppos thi presid sinc the dai he got elect i mean look at who involv here weve got jerri falwel weve got pat robertson no weve done that weve done that mandi and the point im try to make here is i guess im ask both of you but im ask you first how do you ever put a stop to thi kind of thing you did it to our gui were go to do it to your gui and if thei ar success lord know what happen the next time down the road i would hope that right think republican understand that thi is the presid were talk about and there ar so mani tremend issu at stake for the countri so much the republican and democrat could be do togeth we have a crime bill that i think is go to be pass in a bipartisan wai in the next coupl of week a health care bill that also should be pass in a bipartisan wai welfar reform i would hope that there is a wai that republican and democrat can limit their differ to ideolog on argu the merit of differ issu differ approach to health care reform and get past thi undermin of the presid i think thi is a differ case than the thoma case mostli as i said becaus of the monei involv and the question that rais to me about ms <unk> credibl but also becaus thi is after the fact where wa thi woman dure the campaign in that exploratori process rememb anita hill wa a republican who came forward dure the cours of the hear when the question about whether judg thoma wa suitabl for the court wa befor the countri the question of whether bill clinton should be presid ha alreadi been resolv by the american peopl all right let me stop you on that on mandi and ask for <unk> reaction here becaus youv made a number of interest point the monei on the on hand and the fact of the matter that here we have a presid whose busi is all of our busi and it doe make a differ as import as a suprem court justic is a sit presid to handicap him at a time like thi handicap all of us doesnt it it doe ted and it a real tragedi there no question about it the presid should be allow to focu on an agenda i would hope that the republican will focu on the issu becaus we have to do our best to stop the health care plan he try to propos i think we should have philosoph debat on these thing but ill tell you what happen here is these thing have a life of their own thi is paula jone is not part of the conserv movement i certainli have never met her she a young girl a high school graduat who then went on to some <unk> school a work class woman who step forward she wa certainli adopt by a number of veri promin conserv she wa and i think now i believ thi is the reason for that i think it wa veri legitim when she came out becaus her name wa in a nation public that said she had agre to be a girlfriend of the presid she wa protect her reput prior to that nobodi had her name publicli known she kept it quiet the name come out she sai im go to protect my reput then what happen she work class she not an ivi leagu attornei who a professor at a univers who ha a lot of knowledg about the law and ha all the help of the feminist across the countri she a work class woman who know no knowledg of law goe to a friend of her who a real estat attornei who also doesnt know what he do in thi area or in ani area of polit thei take on wrong turn after anoth im the first to admit it but if the feminist had been there and had said listen we put on seminar that state categor women tell the truth if thei had said she deserv her dai in court come given her the kind of expertis she would have had we wouldnt have need the conserv we could have focus on the agenda but thei werent do that thei were go to let her hang out there to dry with carvil and their buddi call them <unk> and trailer park queen and attack the person of these individu that why conserv step in let me let me get mandi in on thi point becaus it a legitim point mandi the feminist on thi issu have been terribl quiet and it all well and good to sai it onli alleg noth ha been proven it wa onli alleg when anita hill made them i think a lot of women ar veri troubl by what happen with thi charg becaus we take sexual harass veri serious and to see it politic like thi and turn into a tabloid issu like thi is veri troubl i think a lot of women group have been veri hesit becaus of the question that iv rais here tonight about her stori howev she came forward and howev she hook up with these right wing group it wa she who went for the monei in thi stori it wa she who i think ha undermin her own credibl by focus on the t v right and the tabloid and the trash for cash aspect of thi when you try to shake down the presid of the unit state peopl ar go to rais question about your credibl and i dont care whether your a colleg professor you know or from a trailer park that is a basic question you have to deal with bai youv got the last word weve got thirti second listen she ha state categor she will take no monei whatsoev if she receiv ani shell turn it over to chariti not in term of thi woman is after her reput not in term of the movi and book right she hasnt bai right correct hee hee well anita hill ha done well on that count as well hasnt she all right i thank both of you veri much bai buchanan mandi grunwald thank ted good of you to join us ill be back in just a moment tomorrow night on primetim if you have a date with the mover primetim ha a warn their undercov camera found some violat youll want to know about

323,730,the diet busi it is claim is just like the snake oil busi and doe about as much good live from c n n new york intellig talk for intellig peopl with doctor sonya friedman hello again ar you on a diet right now what kind low fat no fat weight watcher jenni craig nutri slash system there been endless debat over what work best and whether ani of them work at all and now there ar new accus that the whole diet busi is a scam kathleen thompson is a lifelong <unk> and co author of a new book feed on dream and she sai that not onli ar most diet plan destin to fail but that the industri us the failur and the guilt to get your monei quit a claim now you went underground you did an investig what led you to make that claim well the investig that we did wa base on a lot of studi by a lot of other peopl and then a lot of interview we did hidden camera undercov work and what we discov is that the bottom line is that there is no long term weight loss on these program four out of five peopl who go into the program lose no weight at all thei pai their monei and get noth of those who do lose some weight on out of ten keep it off for as much as two year and in the independ studi we look at for perman weight loss thei consid that seven year onli on out of fifti of those ar abl to maintain it so were talk about on out of two hundr fifti peopl who go in spend monei sometim thousand of dollar have ani long term weight loss but ar you sai that that is the fault of the differ diet program or ar you sai that peopl dont seem to have the capac to follow the direct or the plan that ar given to them it the fault of the program theyr base on outdat and old fashion idea about weight control that have been explod for at least twenti year a reduc calori diet doesnt work and everyon know now that it doesnt work in order to chang your weight perman you have to chang the weight your bodi want to be your set point okai but ar you sai there is someth inher within the busi aspect of thi itself that <unk> or distort or suggest to peopl that thei ar capabl of go to a place that theyr realli not oh absolut what the diet center promis what the diet program promis is that thei will take care of your weight loss your weight problem until recent thei did claim long term weight loss but the f t c made an agreement with them that thei would no longer advertis that but it is the program promis someth thei simpli cant deliv and frequent the method of sell it ar veri open to question ar some wors than other or ar thei all equal bad well theyr all equal ineffect and in term of the bottom line some ar wors than other in term of their sale techniqu the fast program for exampl dont need to sell theyr oper out of hospit doctor and ar usual prescrib by doctor and paid for by our health insur so gener you would sai snake oil to all of the abov and to the program but our next guest doesnt agre with that at all joseph <unk> is a vice presid ar nutri slash system diet clinic and as you have listen to what kathleen sai i would have to sai to you what is your diet go to do for me that i cant do for myself without pai ani monei after well sonya thank you for have us here todai id like to first of all indic that the book that wa written feed on dream is base on sever dozen interview in a few nutri slash system center with a few or a few diet center possibl some nutri slash system center and doe not repres the system there ar thousand of counselor out there todai and in year past and there ar sever thousand diet center out there todai so i think we have to look at thi book in the refer of what it wa written base on and that wa a few dozen interview with a few well let forget the book for just a moment if i mai caus id like to know what is your success rate i mean make the posit statement for yourself and for nutri slash system what can you do ye let me sai that the program of the weight manag program of the eighti do not have long term success rate thei do though i think have laid the foundat for a new gener of program that you will see come into exist in the nineti okai but first of all you agre with her then that in fact the weight loss program that have been in busi present someth that thei realli could not deliv which wa come to our program pai the monei and were go to teach you how to take off weight forev thei didnt do that you agre no no i absolut do not agre in fact i believ the histori of the industri is such that there were program like nutri slash system that were base on sound scienc that help peopl that benefit well do you have the number that were base on sound scienc to help peopl reduc their calori intak cut back on their fat and motiv them to start exercis well if that the case then i would think you would have had to have a veri low recidiv rate your suggest that everi year brand new peopl came into the program and peopl who went through the program did not stai out of it becaus thei were success is that what your sai no not at all in fact what we see ar consum with multipl reason for why thei have a weight problem and the program of the eighti address the behavior aspect of lose weight and where the compani of the nineti ar head and that nutri slash system is head in a direct where were build health promot into the program to make it an integr part and doctor i want to be sure of on thing if you ar complet success you would put yourself out of busi right success in what sens help peopl chang their lifestyl well if everybodi who walk in the front door is abl to lose weight and keep it off after thei walk out the back door you will be so success that you will have put them on the path and allow them to walk awai from your door no not necessarili consum it a life long chang so thei need to keep come back for life no no not at all weight chang is part of an overal behavior pattern and lifestyl chang which take time for peopl to chang peopl go through stage of chang and when thei come into nutri slash system or ani other weight loss program theyr start out learn the proper what we provid is the proper educ on nutrit and sound diet we provid a person plan of action that thei can follow onc thei leav the program and a food system that kind of on for all as mani of the center realli provid were go to get a chanc to hear more about your particular system and some of the new thing that were do but what were realli ask is weight loss intermin a life time plan that mean that diet dont work or do thei well find out more when we continu right after thi so which is it is the weight loss industri empow or exploit the custom dian epstein <unk> co author and former nutri slash system counselor sai that there ar veri few peopl that these diet work for barbara levin is a <unk> at <unk> medic school and she sai that thi particular book is full of medic misinform like what doctor levin well the fact that thei sai that be overweight is not a health hazard is a real problem i mean there overwhelm evid from the n i h consensu panel in nineteen eighti four as well as numer studi that show that be overweight is an independ risk factor for cardiovascular diseas for cardiovascular diseas relat to <unk> hypertens cancer so do you see peopl go to these kind of program then i do see peopl go into these kind of program and i dont think we can link or put all these program togeth there ar some veri bad program and there ar some veri good program for instanc weight watcher it realli the gold standard it base on the american heart associ recommend the nation cancer <unk> recommend all the recommend that we as nutritionist ar do and im do as a research as well all right doctor levin you mai know that weight watcher did not agre to appear with us on thi program and did in fact suggest you as a guest and sinc weve brought up weight watcher let me go to dian epstein and sai thi dian epstein it is now true that weight watcher which ha been purchas by anoth compani offer a food program which it did not in the past and so it too is part of thi food program about kind of eat food that set for you on packag for everyon although there ar some individu choic how do you see that in term of give peopl a start in learn how to eat properli i think it counterproduct becaus i think that peopl have to start where thei ar right now and that is philosoph on of the biggest issu i have with diet you take someon and try to turn their eat habit around immedi it isnt diet and it is go to <unk> in the end and the <unk> go to come back now doctor levin isnt it true that all diet fail i mean that happen to have been the name of a book diet dont work but in fact unless your go to chang for a life time program which would mean inde as i said to joe then im finish with you thank for do your job and goodby forev as oppos to go through the revolv door as so mani peopl do on diet program after anoth well iv spent my whole career talk about diseas prevent and it breast cancer it heart diseas it colon cancer and theyr all relat to be overweight and i have great success with my patient in clinic research trial at the <unk> cancer prevent clinic we empow peopl we cant chang their potenti if thei ar at risk for cancer but we can tell them if you chang your dietari habit possibl lose small amount of weight now im onli talk about ten to fifteen percent of weight so where ar you in thi argument im a littl bit confus im i think that well i think that we have been success i think that there have been disappoint in term of treatment modal i think there ha been a high degre of recidiv but the messag should be that we should not give up it is a life time concern and we need a multi disciplinari approach with medicin with nutrit with psycholog to try and help peopl chang these behavior but certainli obes realli doe affect on health and longev kathleen is dy to get into thi convers go ahead well we realli agre with the idea of a multi disciplin approach to the question of weight manag and we dont believ that weight watcher or nutri slash system or jenni craig or ani other of the program out there is provid that for on thing whatev mr <unk> sai about the program of the eighti and the nineti hi compani is still sell food that is where thei make their monei thei cannot why do we need your food i know how to go to a groceri store i can read label theyv made it simpl for me now your food is expens sixti five dollar a week i dont want to sp <unk> end that well it doctor <unk> but sorri but your fact ar wrong as some of the fact ar in your book nutri slash system ha chang in fact in januari of thi year we just launch a brand new program with johnson and johnson health manag we ar provid a comprehens program design by johnson and johnson the health care giant through our center and i hope to share that program with you dure thi program well do that a littl well talk about that and that program is comprehens in design and it focus on nutrit and lifestyl chang it is design to get long term benefit so i disagre strongli with your fact and i believ the industri ha adjust to the fact of the eighti and is provid qualiti servic ar you still sell food sixti five dollar for the food for the week closer to eighti dollar the food averag about three dollar to four dollar a meal or about sixti nine dollar per week and that in addit to groceri food fruit veget and <unk> milk so it now i also have to purchas other thing from the groceri store and i ask you again that is not typic what i would give you as my weekli allot for a for on person for groceri why should i give you that just to put thing in a packag for me it also take awai from my independ learn skill doesnt it doctor well i think what weve learn is that there ar consum who need the program the wai it design todai there ar howev consum come in on the new program with johnson and johnson health manag where thei would prefer to have a mix of some nutri slash system food and some groceri food so we have begun to chang the program now to give consum more option on the food side of the program and i think what your go to see move forward is that custom will come in thei will join the program thei will get all the counsel thei need and thei will get the program that thei need for them which could be a combin of i want to go to doctor levin as i continu to hear thi and your do veri well if i were go to hire a salesman for nutri slash system your the gui i mean you clearli ar do that and you make it sound as though it reason but im here to <unk> through all thi kind of stuff and to try to find out what is factual doctor levin why in a dai and ag when we ar promot fresh food and were take a look at how thing ar packag would anyon suggest if im look at health and someth that balanc to bui a packag design food well i agre with that i think that we can do it on our own certainli with fresh food and that what im try to teach individu try to teach peopl about the old fashion diet the mediterranean diet for instanc as it appear in past decad that much more help but i want to be fair i want to know if i can justifi that becaus im go to tell you straight out but in the supermarket though there ar mani option a fat free thi and low fat thi and it not veri differ from nutri slash system but might there be some peopl who frankli need in order to get start the control taken out of their hand so that thei can have no choic caus choic get them in troubl and as someon who studi thi in your career would there be a segment of the popul for whom is the right thing absolut i think you hit on it we have individu differ in obes we have a whole huge psycholog arena out there were go to get back to that and what id realli like becaus i doubt that there is a woman here who hasnt been on diet let me assur you i am on of them and have tri mani of these some of them work becaus it my head that make the decis about whether that will happen what about you your experi men and women the diet busi is it just that or ha it work for you two on two six four three zero zero seven seven our number for you it said that there is a sucker born everi minut and a larg proport of us go on diet well what would happen if there wasnt anyon in the diet busi let take some call as we go to <unk> in florida welcom <unk> hi thi is <unk> ye i just want to relat just quickli an experi that i had with nutri slash system iv been on nutri slash system and weight watcher im about twenti pound overweight and i actual lost the twenti pound with nutri slash system and then gain it back three month later becaus i couldnt get along without eat packag food and when i tri weight watcher i just got depress becaus i didnt want to like go in in front of a lot of peopl and get weigh what final work for me wa throw out the diet learn how to eat fresh fruit and eat small portion and walk and exercis everydai and that is what help me the most i just want to sai that it wa psycholog crippl and demor for me to keep fail at diet and when i final took it into my own hand and actual got in touch with a support group and start exercis thing got a lot better i just want to share that that it realli hurt me more than help me when i went on these diet and fail now dian i think that that is the purpos of your book ye it is and i realli applaud the person who call in i think that the statist about long term success ar peopl who do exactli that not onli do thei throw out the diet but the thing that diet program focu on which is weight weight on the scale rather than fit healthi eat those ar not the focu even if the compani state it on paper it doesnt filter down that wai let let doctor <unk> respond dian i suggest that you go into a nutri slash system center immedi after thi show and you learn more about the new program that we just launch thi spring consum now come in get a full <unk> health plan a plan of action thei get educ and thei get guidanc and support so i believ the compani of the eighti will chang and nutri slash system ha taken the first step in that direct kathleen i think that if we were realli talk about get that kind of counsel and that kind of educ then we must be talk about highli qualifi counselor and i would like to ask doctor <unk> what the qualif for hi counselor ar now when we studi for the book we found out that a nutrit counselor could have ani nine hour of class colleg credit in nutrit and a behavior counselor ani nine hour in psycholog that mean thei could have taken art therapi in child psych if were go to have peopl who ar prescrib healthi program do we have peopl that ar qualifi to do it that quit a challeng and a great question and im proud to sai that nutri slash system right now is the onli compani that ha a regist

step thei need to make now to keep the weight off okai let go to bruce in north carolina who join us welcom bruce ye maam i just basic want to agre with you about the motiv aspect you can have the best equip the best diet program but unless you have the willpow to control what you put in your mouth and what type of food whether theyr <unk> balanc food i like to eat a lot of clean food low fat food with the proper amount of <unk> and protein and i think unless you can scientif control what you put in your bodi it just like your bodi is a machin like a car and if you put the proper fuel in your bodi you will get the proper result that you want and if you dont have enough willpow to control what you put in your mouth how in the world do you think somebodi a diet center can possibl give you the willpow or chang your life if you cant even control what you put in your mouth thank you veri much thank you for that were go to go thank for that call well go to cynthia in california now welcom hi sonya ye im a yo yo <unk> i have been for year and what i final discov that it wasnt about willpow and it wasnt about diet i surrend and about two year ago i got into <unk> anonym and i have lost all my weight and iv kept it off and iv maintain my weight and id just like to ask doctor <unk> i dont see how that box can address the issu of im a compuls <unk> i have a diseas and it not about the food thank well what you fail to realiz is it not the box it the total program the program begin with the <unk> assess the import aspect i think is the educ and the support there is a full set of educ materi that johnson and johnson ha develop a full nutrit plan what i think consum need is i think thei need a <unk> plan of action for them that thei can act on to move forward with kathleen i would just like to sai that thei can get a <unk> plan either by do it themselv with the inform from for exampl from our book which thei can check out at the librari if thei cant afford to bui it but the other thing is that there ar individu weight control counselor like doctor levin like dian epstein theyr all over the place and thei can help you thei can actual address your individu problem and cost you less than go to on of these diet center and pai for thi pre packag food you can get help ye mani of us need help sometim it a support group that suffici sometim a counselor is import but that help is avail in place that ar not go to doctor levin what about the fat free food i mean i have to tell you if there on thing i have learn recent is that if it fat free and if it sugar free it also is tast free i am just shock by what is come out as food that ha noth to do with food as far as i am concern and im concern and i think other mai be too that some of what were eat is actual go to increas the amount of calori that we take in becaus it is not realli true to what we need i look at a lot of fat free product recent for anoth show and it wa realli funni becaus we found that the fat free on a cracker that wa fat free as oppos to the tradit cracker actual had more calori fat is not the it is the bottom line i mean it the most concentr sourc of calori but yet we have to think about the rest of the nutrit world and the recommend you know of cours what weve left out weve left out the whole issu of exercis we cant and i believ that in and out and you know susan <unk> ha realli done an incred job for american audienc by tell us someth that quit simpl it is that you breath you eat and you move and gee you dont have to pai a lot of monei for that inform i just gave it to you here we ar at two on two six four three zero zero seven seven weight loss what work anyth let take a call and then well go to you dian i want to ask you a littl bit about your affili with nutri slash system lana from california also had an affili welcom lana hi ye i have been work for actual for nutri slash system incident for about three year and i just want to point out so mani of the peopl that i see that come through the door realli realli need to be open to chang and thei need to be commit to make the chang themselv and it a veri individu need but peopl realli need to their mind need to be you know like an open door and be accept of a lot of differ idea that perhap their idea hadnt work in the past but you know i just get great satisfact out of i realli feel as though i help a lot of peopl from emot issu psycholog issu i do have a background i have a <unk> in nutrit a master in health so i feel as though i have you know some a pretti good knowledg base but i just realli think if peopl realli need to be open and realli need to make the chang and the commit themselv now dian wa also a nutri slash system counselor and what were your feel did you feel you were help peopl i realli did not after i had been there for a while i felt that the profit motiv wa the most import thing and i guess i want to bring out a coupl of point that i think weve overlook here the woman who just call in how do you account for the fact that nineti eight percent of the peopl gain the weight back no matter what program it is were not talk about nutri slash system were talk about the diet industri in gener and secondli the issu of exercis and movement basic movement is total overlook and it is on of the biggest problem if you want to talk about long rang weight loss what you want to do is talk about a bodi that ha more lean than fat and that isnt go to happen entir by what you put in your mouth you burn up fat by move your muscl that isnt a part of these program becaus it doesnt make monei it doesnt sell anyth barbara levin that true isnt it i mean long term i have not seen on studi that did not sai that in order to maintain a weight loss you had to maintain an exercis program for life i think we all should be do that for cardiovascular fit for osteoporosi prevent but you and i for instanc ar approxim the same weight were maintain our weight at veri low <unk> level unless we exercis it go to be veri hard for us to stai as thin as we want to be so your absolut right all of you sai that exercis is import and the psycholog factor with exercis kathleen about exercis i just want to sai that i am im what i call an exercis resist person i spent my whole life hate exercis and think that i wa lazi so when peopl would sai to me well youv got to exercis i would shut off complet and final i learn that my exercis resist wa a lifetim of neg associ of bad experi of pain experi with exercis or sport and so forth now after oh it took me about a year to get to the point where i do twenti minut of stair step three to five time a week and id as soon go without take a bath now as i would without do my stair step but i want peopl to understand that thi is not just someth you do overnight a year to work up to twenti minut is a long time and peopl need to do these thing gradual incorpor them in their live overcom their exercis resist and the other thing is that thi is a whole group of issu it so easi to sai lower the fat and get more exercis but were talk about peopl who have emot issu who have genet issu right you know i agre with that and i wonder if the diet busi doesnt also have a place in some of that and ill get back to that in a moment liz from arizona with us now hi liz welcom liz ar you with us yeah go ahead hi i just want to sai that i have alwai been overweight all my life and now i just need a place to start and it wa five and a half year ago that i went to weight watcher and iv lost sixti seven pound and iv kept it off i just need somebodi to boot me in the butt to get me start all you know to do the right thing and so far it work i love it okai the idea is that here is a woman who wa success but i think <unk> statist ar pretti clear and that is that there ar veri few peopl who can sai that who can sai that thei have lost weight and kept it off for five year and im go to tell you that if oprah winfrei ever give up her chef her person chef who is there for her and who make her food and basic i wish i had on exactli i mean the idea is how mani of us can realli do thi on our own sonya on thing that i want to sai that i know in term of weight watcher look at ten year past life time member which mean that thei have achiev a weight that reason thirti seven to forti percent of those peopl have been abl to keep their ideal bodi weight within five pound i research thi whole area for these thing thi is she sai she done the research kathleen i mean youv done a whole book about thi what group is thi weight watcher no no what group of peopl within weight watcher the on that had achiev ideal bodi weight or a reason bodi weight around through weight watcher ye so it is not of the peopl who go on weight watcher so it a veri small group within the weight watcher commun that actual make that bodi weight that ideal bodi weight no no but that a it a in prepar for thi show i look and i tri to see the success of mani differ program i even start to think about my patient how mani of them were success and i realli did the how mani of them ar success you know i think we have to look at in a step wise manner and i like to try and do target of not we have to lose forti pound for you let try to get you to lose on to two pound per week perhap or let have a goal of lower your cholesterol a certain amount or let try and get your diabet under control and the work that were do at <unk> we have shown that we can actual <unk> the risk of cancer and thi is import well i have to tell you someth i think that diet ar out i think that on of the thing that the jenni craig program ha shown veri recent becaus it lost million of dollar in the last quarter diet is a terribl four letter word is that we ar all go to decid what we want to do on our own and the question is why would anybodi want to pai ani amount of monei to have anyon do thi to you or for you <unk> is our number well there it is all the food you want all you have to do is bui it from on of the diet program let go to jame in arizona welcom hello ye im a psychologist and have been work in the weight loss industri for over twenti year hospit base program research and i fulli agre with kathleen thompson that not onli diet ar ineffect but all weight loss program product servic guru and iv recent put out a book i call hug from the refriger where i look at peopl who ar long term success those who ar long term success did not becom so until thei gave up the weight loss industri well that a veri interest comment and realli what our two co author kathleen and dian have been sai in fact you even made a crack about the weight watcher fast start i thought that wa suppos to be the best wai to get you start on thi well no everyon want to do thi head start ill do ill just go on a diet for a littl while to get a head start on my long term weight loss well thi is veri much like go on a twenti mile hike and get a head start by do the first mile in a wind sprint now it is it doe exactli the opposit of what you want for on the long term it make your bodi adjust to a lower calori level it trigger the starvat respons so that it more difficult for you to eat healthi and <unk> food it just complet counterproduct let go to linda in new york who try to decid what to do linda ye iv been extrem overweight my whole life and iv done you know everi diet plan out there i found that the medic industri the doctor have been total thei just didnt want to deal with me at all and now im on weight watcher iv been on it for about two month and iv got myself a person trainer so im exercis and the weight watcher is go all right it just it veri hard becaus you know you just go there onc a week and then your left the rest of the week all alon to deal with you know becaus i do feel that im an addict and so the rest of the dai you know for the whole week so if you had someth where there wa a counselor that you could call on an eight hundr number or someth that would be benefici to you you need more of a support system i think so and dian epstein how did you final decid to lose weight or did you give up on that no i didnt give up and i go back to what doctor levin said i dont think kathleen and i ar suggest that peopl give up i think were suggest an entir differ approach to thi and just to fill you in a littl bit about myself i had weight problem from the time i wa about ten year old i wa put on diet pill veri low calori diet i did the whole rout of that and how did you final get to a point that your comfort if you ar okai i it took me kathleen talk about on year to get into the exercis it took me about four year to come down about sixti pound now that not what a custom want to hear a consum but it stai off for eighteen year now i did it by make on small chang at a time in both area in food and in movement let me go to doctor levin with that becaus i think that is someth we all have to face i too want the quick start iv lost the same ten pound over and over ill bet you that i could produc if thei would call us fax us e mail us a thousand women in a matter of second who would sai the exact same thing that i just did the question is and then id try it discourag patient i sai it a step wise progress similar to well what wrong with us that were not will to hear that we know the fact about well you want to be in the nation enquir lose twenti five pound in a week overnight while i sleep if you want to know the truth but your not your lose fluid on diet like the atkin diet or the <unk> diet that the diet that kill the doctor whatev diet it wa but to realli lose <unk> tissu we realli have to limit our calori five hundr calori per dai to lose that on pound per week it veri difficult to increas the exercis if onli i could teach my hip to tast the chocol cake i love i could just past them on my hip and walk around with it i could be thin when i take that off start with the qualiti not so much the quantiti in term of the calori but lower the fat increas the fiber get in those import nutrient that were think about and i think we need to sai that each of us is go to have to do thi in our own wai the truth is there is not on system whatev it happen to be for all and know more about your own style and work with someon that you appreci and trust and then write down your goal and see if you get the result that the ticket to success thank for be with us ill be right back thank you for join me todai now tomorrow phil donahu would like to show execut on t v is thi the ultim in sensation or what do you think a deterr to murder perhap,

those who will brief you it will be in excess of on hundr million dollar well have modest commit of american manpow but enough to do the job the leadership came here last night and told you that your health care plan for all intent and purpos is dead and that theyr go to start over with someth veri differ from what you had propos how do you feel about that ar you will to accept thi turn of event first of all i want to tell you i had a predict last night i said to the leadership last night thei said what shall we sai i said well i have been sai for four week we have agre to dramat chang thi plan were go to string it out we have to have a longer phase in we have to have less bureaucraci we have to have total voluntari small busi allianc and we have to give a bigger break to small busi to get them to bui into it ill bet if you out there and sai it it will be treat as new and that is exactli what happen that is exactli what i said to the governor that is exactli what i have been sai for the last three or four week and im glad that it final is go out to the american peopl we listen to the american peopl all of us did so we said when i sent my plan to the congress i implor the congress to go out and offer suggest for chang it for improv it for make it better i did that from dai on i have i am still wait for someon els to produc a bill who believ there anoth wai to achiev univers coverag i thought it wa a veri good meet becaus the leader reaffirm their belief that our object should stai the same univers coverag so that we can provid secur to those who have health insur and cover those who dont now on sixth of our peopl rememb america go in the wrong direct onli the unit state is reduc the number of peopl with health coverag everi year secondli secondli our goal ar the same we reaffirm them the leader reaffirm them univers coverag qualiti and choic an emphasi on prevent and primari care and disciplin and <unk> cost not onli for the govern so that we dont increas the deficit but also for peopl in their privat insur plan and we will have a bill in the senat and a bill in the hous that will achiev those object the burden is then on other final the burden must go to other i would remind you now we have the medic associ the american medic associ sever other physician group the nurs associ the nonprofit hospit associ virtual everi medic center in the countri a huge group of small busi a huge group of larg busi and a wide arrai of other who support these four goal the bill that we will come out with i am confid will reach these four goal how we reach them is now up to the congress work with the white hous but the burden is on those who think thei have a better idea to come forward with it some dai we ar go to have to focu on those who have other altern that is my object i think we will reach those four goal i thought it wa a great meet and my predict wa that if thei would go out and sai what iv been sai for a month that it would make new and sure enough it did and i feel veri veri good about it now i have to turn thi over to them to answer more question about rwanda well you mai be a littl puzzl there as to why the presid would address himself to the suffer of so mani peopl and the question would turn almost immedi to health care but it is a big debat in washington and the presid probabl appropri from hi point of view want to get it back on rwanda so left the white hous brief room and now leav it to the deputi secretari of defens and the chairman of the joint chief to brief the report there on what it is he ha set forward for rwanda well take just a coupl of moment now to talk to among other our nation secur correspond john mcwethi on what thi all mean john the presid i thought wa in some respect sound a littl defens is the u s try to catch up in term of help the rest of the world well that certainli not the wai the white hous is portrai it the presid is sai we ar the leader we have been from dai on and in fact when the unit state <unk> especi ha he ha done todai it set the tone and the pace for much of the rest of the world isnt it actual all true that much of the rest of the world is alreadi do some of what it can and that the u s is slow off the mark there ar more than two thousand french troop that have been in rwanda for sever week the unit state when it doe gear up is not send troop into the countri itself but the u s can bring to bear enorm resourc on the border of rwanda and that is clearli what the presid now intend to do after a delai of some dai now you have heard all of what he said you follow it fairli close from the point of view of the need there what do you hear him sai that he provid most well he is focus on the thing that ar the most immedi need and the thing that the unit state can realli make a differ at what the u s is realli good at do with it troop and with it capabl is move mass amount of materiel and suppli into the area that is what he is go to do he focus on the bottleneck the small airport at goma and there ar other area by the wai than just goma that have acut problem he focus on water he focus on food those ar the kind of thing that the u s can realli make a differ on let me turn briefli to our intern secur consult toni cordesman who is in our washington bureau rush in to help us thi morn toni what can be done in a hurri to allevi thi horrend suffer the kei step ar the on that the presid ha describ that will probabl increas the through put of good to the airport by about six to eight time which is a tremend increas it wont come close to meet the need but it a major differ ad the water will be the critic aspect now there ar a few other thing to be done like air drop but those gener have limit capac the airport ar the test of what can be done in the next week to ten dai toni on of the relief worker in goma last night told a b cs bill blakemor theyr cover about five percent of the need of water at the moment what doe it take and how quickli can you get up to a on hundr percent or anyth even approach it i dont think you can get up to on hundr percent i think the onli wai you could possibl meet the need is to send mani of the peopl back and to dispers them probabl in the next week you can doubl or tripl the amount of water that is avail in the area where peopl ar now concentr if you can dispers them you might be abl to meet somewher between twenti and thirti five percent of the need although ani of those figur ar pure specul but youll never be abl to meet even half the need unless you can chang where the peopl ar and move them to new sourc of water o k toni stand by for a sec if you would and john mcwethi as well we heard mani refuge worker on the ground at these scene yesterdai urg these peopl those who could that person obvious couldnt to go back to rwanda a b cs ron allen who is there for us wa up at the border thi morn we talk to him just a few minut ago and ask him whether there wa ani sign of peopl go back there were sever hundr peopl at the border todai try to get across peopl who sai thei ar tire of all the diseas and the hunger that theyr suffer here and thei think theyd be better off back home so theyr try to cross but todai the <unk> author were there close the border down and would not let peopl cross ani reason why the zair wouldnt let them go back thei sai it not safe there ar a lot of weapon a lot of unexplod grenad

from the rwandan armi as it retreat and join the refuge exodu more than a week ago but we cross easili our vehicl could not cross there is a potenti problem there so as we understand it now the <unk> author ar sai that perhap tomorrow or the next dai thei will open the border when you talk to peopl who ar come across the border from rwanda into zair what do thei tell you thei ar now flee from thei seem to be flee what theyr hear on these govern radio broadcast the propaganda warn them that hutu especi the major tribe in rwanda ar go to be execut by the tutsi mainli tutsi rebel armi which now control vast area of the countri did you run into ani tutsi on the other side and do thei sai that these peopl can come home safe ye we spent sever hour with the rwandan patriot front the rpf thei tour us through some of the area across the border which ar now essenti ghost town thei give everi assur and the rwandan govern the new govern which ha set itself up in the capit kigali ha said todai that thei welcom peopl to return both hutu and tutsi how easili is aid get there at the moment it not get here at all in ani signific quantiti as i understand it peter the number of flight come in is veri small there a lot of congest and confus at the airport and it just not happen as quickli as the relief commun would like it to there is limit fuel distribut but as you can see these road ar clog with peopl it a littl bit open now but often there ar peopl in the wai and truck liter cannot get where thei want to go so there ar all kind of logist problem with the distribut and is the a b cs ron allen interrupt the middl of that convers we had a few minut ago a b cs ron allen in goma on the border between rwanda and zair where the presid sai we ar watch the worst humanitarian crisi in a gener

clinton talk a littl bit about the long histori of the king and hi grandfath here yitzhak rabin is a differ man todai than he wa twenti year ago ye i think so yitzhak rabin after all ha had a militari

face is softer the wai he look at king hussein and by the wai i think king hussein is realli liter smile ear to ear i spoke to him the other dai and he wa on top of the world in a realli good mood so i think these two histor leader who were there at the found of their countri have realli achiev someth you know peter the presid paid tribut to all of the presid and other administr who work for thi and i think it should be a sourc of pride for all american that thi is a triumph of american polici sinc nineteen sixti seven our posit ha been land for peac that wa the secur council resolut two hundr forti two which we sponsor and we insist that the arab in direct negoti with the isra would be abl to determin how much land thei get back for how much peac thei give so we should be veri proud well certainli the histori of the unit state between these two nation ha been intens signific there is a handshak between the presid and the two particip as warm as it is mr rabin i think ha probabl said the most import thing about handshak todai he point out in earlier remark that thi wa a common gestur in so much of the world and while thi wa a subject of endless fascin the king wife and prime

sai a few word in hebrew to the citizen of israel who ar watch us now thank you veri much well you can certainli imagin given the spirit of the moment what the prime minist said in hebrew to the peopl back home as he said to us in english it dusk now in the middl east where these two countri share a longer border than with ani of other of israel neighbor and it mai be dusk there now but prime minist rabin said the peopl of jordan and the peopl of israel must see a great light he said there a great deal to be done after thi veri enthusiast encount with on anoth here in washington todai water and land ar the essenti ingredi of success and failur in the middl east as we said and the statu of jerusalem ha to be negoti and there ar mani thousand of palestinian who either fled or were driven from their home in the forti eight and sixti seven war their futur settlement is an issu and becaus more than fifti percent of the jordanian popul is palestinian there is go to be a delic road for king hussein to walk at home in what is sure the most democrat countri in the arab world judith <unk> our resid middl east analyst how tough do you think it go to be i think it will be much smoother than we anticip obvious the next step is some kind of breakthrough with syria between syria and israel but if we look at the region all the arab countri ar in touch with israel either in bilater talk with sign agreement or with work relationship the onli on that have no contact with israel ar iraq and libya which ar under sanction and yemen algeria sudan which ar suffer from terribl intern crise so <unk> normal ha move dramat in these last two year i think the process is move veri veri well and king hussein ha after all been behind it for fifti year mr <unk> have these two ever met befor i know that king hussein ha met secretli with variou isra leader over the year includ the man who get a vast amount of credit for todai the isra foreign minist shimon pere but have these two ever met befor ye i believ thei have met befor and over quit a period of time the issu of what the prospect ar i think you have to break it down into sever point on is the problem of the palestinian and the all of them includ repatri to the extent thatll take place that will result in trilater negoti as far as the bilater relationship i wa truli amaz at the scope of the announc that we heard todai thi is a realli a peac treati in all but name the issu isnt when thei sign it the issu is to implement these provis and i have everi confid these provis will be implement were also join thi morn by our nation secur correspond john mcwethi john the king said and the prime minist said that the unit state ha done much it is go to be ask to do much more what the u s go to do to make thi all better for these two nation peter the unit state is go to be work veri hard to provid as much negoti stabil all sort of econom incent if that in fact can be negoti but theyr go to be the steadi hand in all of thi encourag the syrian not to stai out in left field where thei now ar try to bring them in along with the other arab neighbor of israel o k and coki robert our polit correspond in washington is also with us thi morn coki on question for you how much credit doe bill clinton get for thi and how much will he get do you think for the american peopl at a time when he could us some he certainli can and particularli on foreign polici matter peter thi certainli help for him to have onc again be at the white hous to have thi scene tomorrow these leader will come here to capitol hill and it will be an american foreign polici success the problem is is that everi time he ha on he seem to have anoth problem some place els in the world and of cours right now with the disast in rwanda and the problem in haiti it will be hard to for him to keep thi on on the front burner o k thank you veri much as we continu to look at the south lawn of the white hous here just on final comment on thi befor we move locat geograph it can realli be said that thi is about destini you heard refer thi morn to king hussein grandfath who first consid peac with the isra in the earli part of the centuri who wrote a letter back in nineteen nineteen i think to think suprem court justic felix <unk> and said that arab and jew ar cousin in race theyv suffer at the hand of greater power and that neither on can be a success without the other it ha been thu throughout thi centuri and now perhap thi gener and as prime minist rabin said subsequ gener of arab and jew could begin to benefit

344,774,white hous counsel lloyd cutler go back befor the hous bank committe which is hold it first round of whitewat hear thi potenti target meet with mr clinton as well as with hi good friend from arkansa and hi chief of staff mack mclarti and webster hubbl and of cours thi is a veri signific meet if it relat back to your desir to keep the presid pristin and out of troubl by give him the so call head up my first question is did the presid speak to jim gui tucker about the matter that we now know as whitewat let me follow up with that and ask you a second question if i might given our time constraint did you ask the presid whether he had such a convers with jim gui tucker i am inform that the presid and jim gui tucker did not discuss ani whitewat matter or anyth relat to mr hale or these other case dure their meet i would like to correct some other thing in the account that you just gave me befor you do that if youll just indulg for on moment would you explain to me how you ar how you were inform of that i wa inform of that by mr bruce lindsei who wa told that by the presid so just to clarifi that point you never ask the presid directli whether he had ani convers regard whitewat with the potenti target jim gui tucker that is correct it is also correct that when mr lindsei gave the presid the inform that these crimin referr had been made he did not know that jim gui tucker wa involv in them he did not learn that accord to mr lindsei and he will be here befor you until i believ the seventh the dai after the meet and all of thi wa simpli from press stori by that time as i understand it the press had alreadi report that jim gui tucker might be a possibl target and i just want to clarifi thi again that lindsei did get a brief base on summari and not base on press stori with respect to the referr he got a brief on the fourth which he doe not recal mention jim gui tucker he learn from press report on the seventh after thi meet about jim gui tucker and he did not tell the presid about ani refer to jim gui tucker my time is alreadi up doesnt thi <unk> the whole rational for give thi so call head up which we us to call a tip off when i wa a prosecutor if you dont ask the presid if you dont protect him from a potenti target when clearli there inform surround jim gui tucker mr <unk> your go backward through press stori or through the offici summari that he wa the offici target the time of the gentleman ha expir you cannot tell the presid what you dont know how do you protect him he didnt know until the dai after about jim gui tucker in ani event there wa no convers in the meet have to do with whitewat and that anoth wai a presid can protect himself you dont know that for a fact you never ask that question mr sander thank you mr chairman let me just make a few brief point and then mayb rais an issu that is of concern to me and i dont believ it ha been discuss yet todai number on let me just reiter i think there is concern legitim concern that were not get into all kind of area that the public is interest in but i would simpli remind the member of the committe that the scope of thi hear is limit by hous resolut three hundr nineti four which wa support by the overwhelm major of the member of the hous let me quot why probabl all of us vote for that resolut and that wa to make sure that thi hear would not interfer with the on go investig of special counsel robert b <unk> in other word there is more to happen we ar go to learn more but i think we can all agre we dont want to interfer with the investig of mr fisk a second point that ha been made veri import basic point is the special independ counsel mr fisk republican as conclud hi investig of foster death and the issu of the context between the <unk> the treasuri and the r t c he ha conclud that foster commit suicid and also that the evid is insuffici to establish that anyon within the white hous or the depart of treasuri act with the intent to <unk> influenc an r t c <unk> the third point that i think we ar concern about todai and that indic that there were in fact as i understand it over forti contact between the white hous staff the treasuri and the r t c staff and i think the bottom line is that the american peopl do want to make certain that charg against madison guarante were treat by the r t c in exactli the same wai that thei would be treat if that bank had no connect to a man who wa elect presid therefor i think thi hear is appropri and i think that it is us although mr fisk ha conclud that there is no basi for crimin prosecut it is absolut appropri that we learn as much as we can from you in term of those discuss and those contact you yourself as i understand it mr cutler have call that poor judgment and well want to know how we can prevent such behavior in the futur mr chairman the issu that i want to rais and i know that mr cutler is familiar with thi issu i dont believ weve talk about it todai and by no mean am i make ani derogatori statement about anybodi on thi committe but what concern me veri veri much is there ar individu who on nationwid radio and televis have dissemin unfound accus that i think nobodi on thi committe believ and im not suggest that anyon doe but unfound accus that have gone so far as to even suggest that the presid of the unit state and mr clinton ar involv in murder ar involv in <unk> and in arson and these ar not just littl peopl who were talk some littl splinter group these ar peopl who on nation radio nation televis make these statement and i am veri concern about these type of viciou polit attack now to my mind what goe on there is not simpli an effort to undermin the presid of bill clinton that what polit is about and that the game we plai but what those peopl ar do mr chairman ar realli undermin the faith of the american peopl in the democrat process i disagre im an independ i disagre with mr clinton all the time so do the republican so do all of us but if you have peopl speak to million of american who ar sai that the presid of the unit state and mr clinton ar involv in murder ar involv in arson ar in involv in <unk> and that what million of peopl ar hear what ar those peopl to believ about the unit state govern why should thei particip in the polit process why should thei vote thi concern me veri much so my question to you mr cutler ar basic two fold number on tell us in your judgment the worst exampl of what you refer to as poor judgment there been a lot of poor judgment what is the worst and second of all if you can sai a word as to how the white hous or how you ar respond or feel about these outrag alleg which again i want to repeat i believ nobodi in thi committe believ those ar my two question well with respect to poor judgment mr sander as iv said befor second guess after the event is alwai veri easi i wasnt there at the time and im sure the peopl who were there act in complet good faith but i think myself that the question of whether mr <unk> should recus himself wa a question he should have decid without consult the white hous and that it wa too bad that the white hous peopl involv indic to him that thei rather hope he wouldnt thei had a prefer that he wouldnt thei mai have had perfectli good reason for that my own view is that onc the matter came up it would have been better and i believ what i would have done at the time is sai go ahead and recus that given the polit and factual circumst of whitewat at the time it would have been better to recus and we might not be here in thi hear todai i might still be practic law instead with respect to these attack on presid and mr clinton thei have reach a level of <unk> and <unk> if youll let me sai that that is unparallel a new low level is probabl the wrong word a new low unparallel at least in my experi in the govern that goe all the wai back to w w i i im sure therev been other period in american histori when other presid have been vilifi and weve surviv it but thi seem to be veri well financ it a cottag industri there ar a great mani peopl appar who would like to be bring presid clinton down who will stop at practic noth i talk earlier about trust i realli deplor the lack of trust of on parti for anoth of the public for the presid of the press for anyon in public offic todai i think weve reach a low that should make us asham of ourselv it on thing for the press and anyon exercis first amend right to be abl to sai what he want about an administr and it good for us but i come back as i said the other dai to mr joseph <unk> statement when he wa counsel for the secretari of the armi deal with senat mccarthi have you no decenc and i think it someth of which we should all remind ourselv the time for the gentleman ha expir mr <unk> in respons to the question of berni sander the independ from vermont todai onli wit white hous counsel bemoan the fact that there is the vilif of the presid of the unit state you heard him sai that thi attempt to get the presid he said there ar peopl who would like to bring the presid down he said thi attempt is veri well financ he said it a cottag industri and in refer to some segment of societi includ the new media he said weve reach a low that should make us asham of ourselv,

347,777,the media and minor mayb it time to take the messeng to task live from c n n new york intellig talk for intellig peopl with doctor sonya friedman hello again im deborah marchini fill in for doctor sonya friedman the widespread media coverag of o j simpson trial mai have more to do with hi celebr than hi race but that hasnt stop mani from us thi case as a springboard for discuss concern <unk> distrust of the new media the darken photo illustr of simpson on the cover of time magazin and earli footag of him in handcuff infuri mani minor thei believ the case would have been cover differ if simpson were a white suspect and have onli serv to perpetu racial stereotyp my first guest is robert <unk> he a professor of commun at north carolina state univers he ha spent half a dozen year studi the portray of african american on network new weve seen poll professor show that african american have a beef with the wai theyr portrai on network new is it a valid on ye my studi have shown that black ar systemat stereotyp by local new and network new in what wai basic when it come to crime stori which ar veri heavili cover on the local new black ar made to appear more violent danger even when thei ar accus in the same type of crime as white suspect for exampl thei ar shown twice as much physic restrain by a polic offic than white even when theyr accus of similar crime is network new better or wors than network new well in it track record on treatment of minor network new is differ so for exampl there isnt as much coverag of you know your averag street crime on the other hand i think network new coverag of polit is probabl wors so you get onli the occasion black leader who usual there becaus he commit a crime or done someth heinou and it give a <unk> of black polit o k we ar also join now with from anoth guest with anoth guest felix gutierrez with the freedom forum foundat is join us from atlanta georgia he is among other thing the co author of the book minor in the media felix youv just heard what professor <unk> had to sai about the wai african american ar treat in the media doe the same thing appli to hispan american and member of other minor i think you can sai so it a fair comment to sai that when were cover were cover as problem peopl peopl who ar either <unk> by problem in that we mai be poor we mai come from anoth cultur and we speak anoth languag or peopl who ar caus problem for the larger societi and that focu get into coverag of crime and other kind of issu o k let me plai the devil advoc here and ask you a question which is to what extent ar member of minor problem peopl ar minor be cover as particip in crime becaus thei ar particip in crime more often i think were be cover as particip in crime becaus that what we ar <unk> or see or have some impact on the white societi were portrai as a threat were portrai as someon who ha come in to chang thing who perhap is bring someth differ and for that reason that where thei perceiv us we ar cover through anglo ey not as we realli ar and until that len is remov and we ar abl to portrai ourselv in our own light and peopl ar abl to appreci us in our own light were go to see thi kind of coverag professor <unk> in term of the wai and frequenc with which african american ar portrai in the new media in crime situat to what extent is it becaus of their particip rate in crime well there ar two thing to sai number on it is true that on averag statist young black male ar more like to commit crime than young white male but a lot is left out of that stori if you dont give the whole context what left out what left out is first of all middl class black ar no more like than middl class white to commit crime and number two there the whole context of racism and discrimin lack of opportun which probabl caus that increas crime but your point would be that it ha noth to do with skin color i dont think certainli it shouldnt have anyth inher with skin color if it did then middl class black would be out commit all of these crime and theyr not o k iv also seen statist that show that black african american ar more like to be victim of crime than white american doe the media coverag reflect that it doe show a lot of black victim but what iv on of my research project found that if the stori is about a black victim thei get about sixti percent of the coverag of white victim so there less attent to black victim it would appear o k felix gutierrez there bia here you think isnt there i think there is and it becaus the peopl who ar at the manag level and upper level of these new organ ar not fulli reflect of the commun that theyr cover as thi nation becom increasingli more peopl of color these issu ar go to becom more import what you seem and were go to have to find wai to bridg and to build connect between these commun what you seem to be sai sir is there ar too mani white peopl mayb too mani white male run new organ im sai is that what your sai im sai it but ill sai it in a posit wai there ar not enough peopl of color who ar run new organ newspap todai ar still onli ten percent minor wherea were about twenti five percent of the popul and televis station ar onli about eighteen percent again so there a big gap there can i and until we bridg that gap o k were not go to see substant chang professor <unk> i just want to add a littl i agre that an import goal there some evid that no matter who run these organ unless you redefin new and look at the respons of new organ differ it doesnt matter i mean there ar black produc black anchor out there who ar tell the stori that ar indistinguish from what white peopl would be sai if thei were in the same posit so the problem goe even deeper than just the manag the problem goe deeper than just the manag mr gutierrez what do you think about that i would sai it the other wai it goe higher than the manag that he level that he mention produc ar not member of the board of director new director ar not peopl who ar network presid were talk about the veri top level of manag and execut leadership for these corpor but sir were not talk about line produc in my experi at least sir top manag ha virtual noth to do with the dai to dai content of the broadcast thei dont do anyth with the dai to dai content except hire the peopl and set the agenda and to target the audienc that thei want to reach and if thei target a racial divers audienc i think what were see with the growth of minor focu media in thi countri includ channel direct to peopl who speak spanish and other languag is that peopl will pai attent to the media that pai attent to them and if the mainstream media dont want to pai attent to us we will go to other altern all right until thei learn thi lesson theyr go to end up lose audienc and were go to end get the short end on coverag all right we need to take a break right here when we come back well talk more about the mainstream media lose audienc and talk to some minor journalist when sonya live continu nation t v new show make race relat wors white forti four percent african american forti two percent hispan twenti nine percent asian nineteen percent sampl error is six percent point is the media <unk> minor join me now is the presid of the nativ american journalist associ paul <unk> he in atlanta attend the uniti nineti four confer which is examin the role and influenc of minor in the media he sai the media ha definit misrepres and <unk> hi commun and here with me in new york is televis produc rai nunn he work for a b c and n b c and is now execut produc at the medic new network he sai that dure hi time with a major network a major broadcast network he wa alwai battl coverag which he felt promot stereotyp let me ask you rai first of all what weve seen some poll that indic that white and black think that network new <unk> race relat almost to the same degre is it a valid point i think it is becaus what happen is we tend to in the media we go for the quick sell stori and quick sell simplist solut tend to either on confirm stereotyp or sometim quit frankli thei pander to peopl fear o k do you feel that you as a televis produc have done that yourself i think that sometim in stori that i cover earli on in my career i wound up cover and produc stori that inde did have that effect i think as i went along in the career and wind wound up have a bit more influenc at a b c and c b s and princip at a b c i never work at c b s but i think that in those place that i had a bit more influenc i wa abl to try to <unk> the stori in what i felt wa a more balanc direct why earli in on your career did you produc stori that you felt were not balanc as you would have like quit frankli lack of experi or pressur from manag i think it on a lack of experi two quit with an equal issu is the pressur i mean you ar insid of a situat and as the professor mention earlier there is a certain kind of dynam insid these institut and you must first prove that you can make it within that system and it <unk> you to some extent and onli onc youv proven that you can make it in their do will someon then listen to you when you sai but i beg to differ until youv establish yourself your realli without portfolio and realli your someon that thei dont listen to so for a while your not in a posit to help you have to kind of go along that right to get along that why the emphasi on bring more minor in uh huh especi at the lower level is it thi actual creat a fals impress paul <unk> if nativ american have a beef with the wai the media <unk> them what is it well i think that far too often were not portrai at all if you look at the poll that wa just up on the board a littl bit earlier youll find that it talk about hispan black asian american but there ar no nativ american and mayb peopl couldnt find ani nativ american peopl to poll i think unfortun that we seem to be not onli unrepres but inde when other peopl of color ar deal with issu about nativ american and cross cultur stori part of our experi is simpli through the public school system and colleg which is anoth institut that need to be abl to chang in order to educ peopl that nativ peopl ar not onli histor but theyr present in their futur tens so we need to demand access in portray at all it far too often were just simpli absent from the formula altogeth professor <unk> ye i speak i see you nod in agreement i wa agre particularli with the difficulti of find out what nativ american think becaus of the technolog of poll it veri expens and unfortun becaus there a lot of poverti in nativ american commun thei ar less like to have telephon and that becom a difficulti in find out what thei think but i think everyth els the gentleman said is quit true all right what about poll white in term of what thei think of the media coverag of black do you think white think media coverag of black is fair or unfair what iv seen is that some white acknowledg that thei ar stereotyp but mani more black feel that wai perhap natur o k rai do you have an opinion on that well i think it true the black and would feel that were be stereotyp becaus if we know the situat in which we live actual iv run into a number of white who make the point that well thei think it an <unk> sometim the coverag on minor and black hispan indian whatev thei just think well why your obsess with it and i think that is an indic that we realli havent done the job of explain to the rest of thi societi how dramat the societi is chang we havent prepar them for chang we havent educ them about the chang demograph of thi countri felix gutierrez what the appropri remedi of bias new should minor journalist cover minor stori i think there alwai an abil there and an opportun to make us of languag and cultur skill that you mai have but i dont think that minor peopl should be confin onli to those stori nor do i think that white report who have an interest and abil in cover those stori should be abl to do that if it a good new stori if it a top stori if it someth that import sai someth that cut across the board and affect all of us then all of us should have the chanc to cover it is there anybodi here who disagre with that statement i it just what mr gutierrez said remind me to sai that on of the problem with the definit of new is that an isol instanc of crime that happen last night probabl doesnt affect mani peopl so i would like to ask new organ to redefin what thei mean by new uh huh and i think that if you add to that on other point is that in defin new what we realli need is a matter of perspect you dont want to exclud minor african american or hispan from cover stori about their commun nor do you want to exclud white what were realli look at is that the perspect the spin on the stori realli begin in the execut suit where the execut produc if your in a televis oper sai o k thi is what we want to go after and that where we ar sai includ us in the perspect make process includ us in their manag process and that where were definit absent paul <unk> as presid of the nativ american journalist associ let me ask you you sai that nativ american ar basic be left out of the new coverag altogeth perhap with the except of casino gambl here on the east coast what stori ar we the mainstream media miss well i think the mainstream media is miss hord of stori we can go just down the line of the typic stori that mainstream media is deal with and appli them to the nativ commun we have leader we have <unk> issu we have mani thing that the can be cast in a wai that help educ educ the public so that some of the crise that peopl face as nativ american gambl came about certain treati right issu on and off the reserv occur we would have such a crise to deal with what crise what issu specif well there all kind of issu definit right now on of the top issu that peopl ar talk about is mascot and logo and their us in the sport and in the media of these caricatur which ar insensit anyth from the atlanta brave includ the atlanta brave which is own by turner broadcast who mani mani offend uh huh last night at on of the forum in which a number of execut were address wa a question about how what kind of a polici can be adopt in term of the us of mascot logo and caricatur for busi or sport purpos nobodi answer the question and on answer that came out from arthur <unk> wa simpli that he wa from a town where there wa the new york yanke and while he apolog for that i think the absenc spoke for itself all right we need to take a break right here when we come back wed like to hear from you in the audienc the number is two on two six four three zero zero seven seven were talk about race and the media and whether the media is fair sonya live continu welcom back to sonya live were talk about the media race and fair and we have a caller katherin from wisconsin katherin what your question or comment yeah well i have a comment in nineti three i took the year to do research into local newsroom across the countri and to what extent their interest wa in develop women and minor uh huh at manag and execut level i found that nineti four percent of the newsroom across thi countri were cover by white male and i find it veri disgust and so i took nineti four to start an approach into the publish of newspap and the execut at the televis station to solicit and to recruit for them minor i am a twenti year <unk> in the intern busi uh huh and i found the lack of interest on their part in my work for them and bring in manag with my experi i would have thought that thei would have been interest in develop more divers what i also found that the interest level in the minor <unk> such as the american associ of black journalist and asian journalist wa not that strong and so i wonder how i as on individu attempt to help in <unk> can do more rai nunn is it tough to crack manag in network televis at least it exceedingli difficult to crack manag there ar ceil women that iv colleagu of mine have talk about it and insid a b c as well as men especi minor men that iv talk to there is a ceil we know it in it sens you sens that it is that if you ar an o k produc a veri good produc inde that just fine but when you start press and sai but i can make decis and i want to make decis that becom inher difficult that somehow rais the iron and the ceil start lower and the next thing you know boom youv hit it and i want to make just on point right now in atlanta there ar sever thousand minor journalist assembl and ill bet you dollar to donut that what you will hear from everi execut down there is were down here becaus we want to find talent the reason why we dont have talent in the execut suit is becaus we thei just arent train and we cant find ani that the biggest lie theyv been tell it for thirteen year and enough alreadi we have somebodi down there it paul <unk> as a matter of fact paul is that what your hear well i think that were hear a lot of commit the reason were down here is to try to <unk> a posit partnership in which were a full partner in <unk> journalist up and make sure that the opportun is there bring peopl togeth with resourc inde there a lot of skeptic about some of thi simpli becaus when we walk through the newsroom like when we walk through the c n n newsroom we see visibl how colorless some of these newsroom still ar so were not see the result of the word that ar be spoken felix gutierrez what do you know about minor in the newsroom and their represent there as oppos to in other workplac well it still a veri segreg profess realli with onli ten percent of newspap report and editor be from peopl of color and for us in term of them move up the glass ceil issu the hard part for us isnt do the job it get the job becaus we just simpli ar not afford the opportun thi is still a suppli and demand situat and if there wa a demand for peopl of color at the veri top level thei could be found all right we have a call also from tom in oklahoma whom i believ ha a comment or a question on the o j simpson case ye i do in deal in listen to the initi <unk> of the o j simpson hi alleg murder i heard veri littl if noth about the perceiv racism that the question that float to the media right now until it wa mention by media personnel cover the stori and i wa wonder thi is a question for all of your panelist if thi is an issu not creat by the defens or the prosecut but creat by media <unk> to the issu for instanc especi in thi case that a that a veri good and veri interest question professor <unk> let me start with you i dont think there is ani wai to escap the issu of race either we talk about it overtli or we make believ it doesnt exist well ha the defens but it there ha the defens been drum up interest in race as an issu sure thei have and the process well thei theyr the you know the racist white cop allegedli and so forth and i think that part of high tech defens now but our but our caller is correct in a sens that a lot of the talk about race as an issu in thi trial start befor those alleg were made that why im sai it alwai there in america and either we can bring it out and be honest about it or make believ it doesnt exist the question is then and ill ask you rai is the media make race more of an issu than it is no i dont thei realli arent and i not in the and not in the case of o j it a matter of whether or not theyr put it in perspect but thei arent make it more of an issu were talk about it over our back yard were talk about it when were when were at social function and let face it american do that what we talk mayb what were not do as media is put it in an effect context where we ar allow thi notion to persist that that somehow thi is a fallen black role model instead of ask ourselv wait a minut is role model the right is that is that the right place to put anybodi who an entertain or perform be a most valuabl player doe not make you a most valuabl person but we have taken that rout we have accept it in thi countri becaus it a shortcut to the notion of prove and demonstr equal all right we need to take a break right here when sonya live continu were go to talk a littl bit more about race and the media well look at entertain and whether it track <unk> ani better than the new media and take more call sonya live will continu nation t v new show give too much coverag to crime white fifti nine percent hispan fifti on percent asian forti three percent african american thirti five percent sampl error is six percent point as the time slash c n n poll have show white survei believ the nation media spend too much time cover crime while african american think there isnt enough crime coverag well join me now u s a todai columnist barbara reynold she sai media coverag of minor is just plain aw barbara good to have you with us glad to be here if white think were spend too much time cover crime and minor member think were not spend enough cover crime who right is thi a symptom of bia i think theyr both right it who your put the camera on for exampl most statist have said that eighti five percent of those who us drug ar inde white so cover the crime scene and take your camera take your pencil go out into the suburb let get to the heart of the problem the heart of the problem is that nineti five percent or more of all decis ar made by white male in thi industri you look at who ar the white hous correspond you look at who ar the talk head the t v pundit you have three african american columnist who ar femal in thi countri im on of them certainli there ar mani african american women who can write and report your look at a world that is but that is defin report and analyz through the ey of white male barbara reynold i have to argu with you here i have two gentlemen sit right here in new york in thi studio with me both of whom have said that sometim the bias coverag come from black anchor now let me explain why thi exist there wa a report by the nation associ of black journalist last year that said on third of the black ar no it wa two third of the black in newsroom ar afraid to even rais the issu of race that the newsroom ar so hostil to peopl of color that mani of them ar afraid to speak out and rais the question of race becaus thei fear that thei will be fire or wont be promot i think i i dont i think <unk> point is signific here we dont have a real disagr with the experi certainli that i have had and in the in the newsroom suggest that both person when i began you no on wa go to listen to me and too it took a long time befor you i felt confid enough to buck the system myself and sai wait a minut thi is all wrong and then you still ar try to look for a sympathet ear and why should you alwai be try to find thi sympathet ear why it would be much quit frankli it would be much easier we would be i would have been much more product if that ear and that percept on how to cover a stori had exist insid the execut suit right and if you push and you rais these issu you get the label of a <unk> and often your career doe not take off it is not just about what is happen to journalist we all care about the media for exampl when you go to the o j simpson stori you sai how did the issu of race get start i can tell you how on june twenti seventh we had thi cover in time magazin of a shade of a sinist look magazin cover of o j simpson that wa doctor to show him or suggest that he wa sinist and therefor guilti he wa doctor actual to make him look darker id like to poll all of my guest well no not darker but not darker number no it wasnt just hi face it wa how the whole cover i have it right here it wasnt just hi face becaus dark in itself is doe not sai your guilti but it wa the theme the shade of the whole thing that wa doctor ar you it wa ar it wa design to make him look more menac ye exactli and you dont think it wa design to make him look more black no that not the same thing number not number it not the same thing it wa for dramat it wa for dramat effect and the veri notion that somehow the editor didnt know it uh huh i that thi would be offens i find that hard to believ rai youv you sound almost like your defend them though number i am not defend them i i mean it wa done we know what thi busi is about a larg part of it is we want peopl to bui the magazin and the newspap and we want peopl to watch the show but at the same time if you allow those forc to influenc kei decis about signific stori were not talk about the lion king here were talk also not onli an individu right but were talk also about the broader issu of race in america and that when you have to throw out thi notion that somehow iv got to sell paper magazin and stori right and sai let be straight up about it exactli it not just with the o j simpson case you can look at the june thirteenth issu of newsweek becaus you dont want to just let it appear that time did someth wrong and other dont o k whatd newsweek do when you look at thi newsweek you see three peopl on the cover under the caption virtu penni <unk> william bennett and hillari clinton now the issu is <unk> those who care about declin moral well theyr all white it give the impress that someth angel someth piou is about white peopl those who caus the moral declin would be black but so would you have a cover of evil and have it under black face the <unk> well that a veri good question but you rais anoth good question and a seriou on barbara and that is what kind of role model ar we portrai here for minor member let me put that question to felix gutierrez well the kind of role model were plai is where weve seen the opportun that why o j simpson such a hero weve had opportun in sport weve had opportun in music weve had opportun where talent is the real basi for how far you go what is the new coverag and weve been exclud from other kind of profess and new coverag is the caus of that but i dont think so you think the new coverag is mere reflect that and you dont think the new coverag is bias and that it onli cover minor athlet or minor entertain no i think it is bias in the sens that it doe not cover us in our full rang we have doctor we have lawyer we have economist we have peopl who have opportun to show their expertis in a wide rang of area but the media dont go to that thei still focu on problem peopl and thei focu us in new stori in our full glori as mexican independ dai or pow wow or chines new year but right asid from that and asid from a few celebr you dont see us in the media im remind and that intent im remind of someth that goe to what mr gutierrez is sai when we did a documentari at a b c call black and white america on segment had to do with african american who were in who were middl class and in profess on promin critic for a newspap wrote what wa the point why have them in there and i tri to explain you dont realli get it do you that thi is a chanc to show the full rang of who we ar it is import for peopl to see that it not just athlet it not just perform but the fact that an opinion make a critic miss the boat on it tell you i cant if he miss the boat i have no hope that the averag joe sit on the walk down the street in atlanta is go to get it let as professor robert <unk> ye but what who sai six i have to weigh in here on thi issu all right ill give you a second of the hero go ahead ye becaus so mani peopl think that an athlet is a hero which rule out women you know what about us if we cant plai footbal there ar femal athlet well we cant plai footbal were not hero thi is a wai that the media <unk> defin hero for peopl of color and i would sai that just your an athlet or have on a uniform that doe not make you a hero nor a role model i want to ask robert <unk> sinc youv spent nearli six year studi the sai african american ar portrai in network new do we see ani african american doctor lawyer or other profession or all is all we see entertain and athlet we see rel few of those profession in stori that arent about some kind of black issu like crime or poverti right and is that accur or is it bias i think the impress it leav is bias as weve been sai becaus it in the context of most of those black you see be sport figur and crimin all right we need to take a break right here im afraid were out of time well come back in just a minut and take more of your phone call on sonya live welcom back to sonya live where were discuss minor and the media we have a call from lisa in washington state lisa what your question or comment well my comment is that i wit a drug deal go bad and i knew the gui wa a dope dealer what happen wa by the time it got to the new there wa a lot of specul oh it a carjack and oh you know ooh is it a gang from is it a gang from l a ar we have gang in seattl thei didnt you know thei didnt it wa a white person that came from the suburb to bui drug in my sister neighborhood uh huh i just happen to be there uh huh and saw the whole thing do you think it reflect ani bia on the part of the new media i think it obviou that that wa bia how how so in what wai it wa obviou becaus here what peopl saw wa a what peopl saw wa black peopl be portrai as you know these violent type that you know want to steal white peopl car and white peopl better be thei better watch out and thei better bui gun and keep black folk in on littl space you know keep them in the c d and stai out of the c d oh you know she wa a white woman she shouldnt have been drive in the c d that what that the first thing that i saw professor robert <unk> do you want to address that yeah thi bring to mind the coverag of the lo angel riot uh huh in which it wa found that black made up the major of the peopl you saw on the screen but in fact latino were the major of peopl who were arrest dure the riot peopl have in their mind a sens that well if it a riot it must be black and that in fact wa a veri integr activ of mayb on of the few that we have in the countri felix gutierrez i want to put that question to you becaus it a good on do hispan get not as bad a rap as african american when it come to the media we dont get as much inclus across the board uh huh the media still frame racial issu in black and white but that a veri good exampl of an issu that wa frame in black and white even though it wa also a latino situat it wa a latino and it wa asian and it should have been becaus those peopl who were out there for whatev reason had reason to be out there to riot or to loot thei were feel the same impress that the black were and until we can onli think until we look at thi countri as the multiraci countri that it is the new media ar not go to be do an effect job of tell peopl what realli happen so you would almost make the argument that the white new media wa so bias against african american in that situat that thei didnt bother to look to see who wa realli do the do the riot and thei didnt dont have a clue what realli go on well it might be becaus thei dont have peopl that can speak spanish it could be becaus thei dont have peopl who ar realli interest in go beyond the what thei feel is the obviou stereotyp thi is a multiraci countri and certainli lo angel im a nativ of east lo angel is an area that ha the most racial divers of ani citi and that stori should have been cover in that wai and on other point id like to make there uh huh go ahead it veri difficult to cover a riot to make decis about a riot in lo angel when the kei <unk> ar sit in new york citi and what you wind up do oftentim is fulfil their expect their assumpt about the stori becaus let be veri clear that even if your a bureau chief in l a if that execut produc sai i want thi im look for that or you sens that what he or she want and basic were talk about men you go give it to them all right we have anoth call from <unk> in tennesse <unk> what your comment or question is <unk> with us thi is paul o k we seem to have lost <unk> id like to answer that question also barbara ye ye uh huh i want to answer that question sure first of all you the expect issu is veri import it so hard to get good new out about african american for exampl there ar report that show that the main group who is win in sai no to drug ar young black teenag the second group of peopl in anoth categori those who ar sai no to cigarett ar young black men in nineteen seventi six thirti six percent of young teenag smoke both black and white now that ha gone down to eight percent of young black men young black men ar sai no to drug but you cannot see these ar from offici govern report you try to get the new out but the media for some reason ha it lock in their mind that young black men ar thug or ar gangster and ar <unk> and thi ha been there a thi of cours is perpetr i can all right barbara by entertain i can make a similar observ and address it to paul <unk> which is that much of what we hear about nativ american american indian have to do with alcohol absolut i think it just show the power of the press to creat certain imag becaus in the nativ commun there is there ar mani sober profession peopl on of the exampl of how the press ha dealt differ on a racial and a financi basi which includ the o j simpson case histor wa the differ in how patti hearst wa dealt with in term of the crime commit when she wa with the s l a and how the crime and scenario wa built around leonard <unk> leonard <unk> wa poor he wa in the minor and patti hearst though wa a victim all the wai through the string of crime that were commit there but she had monei and she wa white and she wa femal and everybodi feel that the media wa more sympathet to patti heart absolut do we have agreement on that point here i dont think there ani doubt about that o k we have <unk> from tennesse back on the line understand <unk> what your question or comment ye i have a question and a comment on is your not onli the media but your show on t v portrai black in troubl alwai uh huh you know like youv got your thirti minut show the cop show alwai portrai a black be arrest and mother leav kid unattend and also my question is what can we do in our commun and in school to educ children and teacher to teach peopl that thi is realli not true that we can prevent thing like thi from happen and we shouldnt listen we shouldnt believ everyth that the media sai <unk> make a realli interest point too becaus she talk not onli about new program but entertain program let me ask you robert who doe the worst job of portrai minor the new or entertain well it a close call but i would sai the new becaus the new is real and peopl know it real and i think it scari and what i wa go in respons to that earlier caller sure is that the new doesnt and also what barbara reynold said the new rare show solut it show a world out of control in which noth much good is happen and peopl dont seem to be abl to grasp the world and make it better so i think part of what happen is that gener tendenc but at least in entertain i think you actual get a wider rang of black do a wider rang of thing than some other minor although i think other minor ar more ignor all right well i think entertain is even wors you have uh huh show that ar posit show like roc be taken off the airwai and show that ar neg project black neg like lawrenc ar that stai on you have an industri who refus to give record contract to group that arent talk neg about women or swear or thing like that so you have a i think a sort of a diseas here an infect of certain neg idea that you peopl just seem to hold all right we need to take a break right here more on race racism and the media when sonya live continu welcom back to sonya live were discuss race and the media barbara id like to go back to you and just ask be a littl bit of a cynic if i can and sai o k so the consensu here is the media bias so what whose life is be affect here i think the life of everi american first of all we oper in a democraci you cant have a democraci if your institut arent free the media ar the institut that ar suppos to uphold freedom and fair if we arent be free nor fair we ar <unk> the public the readership and the viewership for exampl if i saw all of the new and i look at all of the <unk> and all of the anchor peopl and all of the report and all of the editor who ar african american women it might occur to me that hmm i dont think we deserv that <unk> why white male cant see that were have a brown of america twenti five percent of the public the popul ar peopl of color and of cours i dont weve got on i dont subscrib to thi word minor becaus thi is anoth label that you pin on peopl the word mean insignific and small we ar peopl of color all right not minor player all right well weve got on white male sit here who ha done some studi of thi issu and perhap can shed more light on the question of whether peopl live ar be affect by the bias that you have seen i have i have done studi that show that peopl who reli more on local t v new for the for their new tend to be more racial bias even control for their partisanship and ideolog and so forth so ye it is heighten racial anxieti and tension among white peopl but what i want to sai is it is in white peopl to becom more understand and empathet with other ethnic group all right let me ask my guest in atlanta felix gutierrez first of all let me start with you what do you think is go to be settl at thi confer what do you think will chang anyth the kei thing is that were not here as adversari to the media were partner with the media

differ with as i sai i dont rememb some of the thing in here i dont rememb i dont rememb for exampl the whitewat compani i just dont rememb that ye maam but the bulk of what is here is my recollect of what i wa told by mr <unk> do you have ani reason although you might not rememb everyth about what transpir in the meet do you have ani real reason to differ with hi note number no sir ms hanson did you check with the treasuri ethic offic befor the februari second white hous meet i ask you and you said no is that right i thought you ask me about the septemb meet the first white hous o k the first on did you check with the white hous did you check with the treasuri ethic offic befor the februari second white hous meet ye i did you did and what did thei tell you if anyth we discuss gener the topic that mr altman intend to discuss did thei talk to you about the proprieti of the meet and how it would the percept of it did you go into that i spoke with the deputi gener counsel who is the treasuri design agenc ethic offic for hi peer and what advic did you get if ani he said he didnt have an object to the meet no object to the meet o k i believ you were ask earlier about your about when mr altman testifi befor thi same bank committe back in februari i forget the exact date and you were in the audienc you were counsel seat right behind him if i recal is that correct that correct what and you recal i recal you us the phrase that you said and i quot you thought that it would requir further <unk> on some of hi answer is that your word those ar my word o k but did you ever while he wa testifi hand him a note or someth to refresh hi recollect about these question that were be ask for him i recal hand him note from time to time but do you recal if these were to correct some of these answer and he didnt he ignor the note or what i dont recal sir i recal that ms <unk> and i draft a respons to an answer to a question we anticip dure the hear and gave that to him for him to look it over but i dont recal exactli what els what he did with it if anyth do you well he kept that on to us for an answer it wa a question that we didnt have a specif answer to and draft it dure the cours of the hear and i pass him some other note as well i dont recal what thei were were some of those note and thi will be my my time is up my last part of thi question were some of the note that yall would pass to him then would thei be to help him further elabor on hi answer like we all do i dont recal that ani that there were ani note of that type o k my time is up i want to yield to senat mack who is go to continu on their side iv spoken to senat damato i want to just take a minut myself i think it ill elabor on thi more at a later point i think for your refer and the refer of ani other person that come befor a senat or hous committe in a situat such as the meet were refer to if inform is ask for by a senat let keep it on the senat side and an incomplet answer is given and to get the inform later is not the same thing as give a full and respons answer at the time particularli if there ar follow up question if there a pattern of question that make it clear that senat ar try to understand someth if there ar incomplet answer on after the other and your there in the room and you possess the knowledg and you allow that to go on i think you have some oblig you and anybodi els in that situat to respond in real time that why we have hear ye you put stuff in the record that you mai not have the inform on at the time if youv got to go find someth and put it in the record that on thing if your sit there and you have the inform and it withheld that is not proper in my view whether your the person do the testifi or somebodi you directli report to is sit there do the testifi and is give answer not onc but more than onc that ar incomplet and you recogn to be incomplet i think there an oblig to respond in real time and you can write a note as you sai just did with ms <unk> on someth els you can certainli write a note in that area and i sai that to you but to everybodi els that might be there in an equival situat a later respons down the line for the record is not the same thing as a true and accur respons in real time do you understand what im sai i do understand what your sai sir if i might as i state mr altman wa testifi he had question and answer in front of him and i had everi reason to believ that he wa make decis as he testifi the issu befor us now have assum much more import and signific than thei had at that particular time as i state i fulli expect that we would respond in an orderli wai and respond fulli and complet to everi question and there wa no intent on my part sir not to do that mr chairman could i have ten second on thi follow up yeah sure go ahead of cours mr hanson you said that mr altman had the question and answer befor him were these a lot of the question that were anticip like in prepar for the oversight hear and some of the answer that you all had prepar or he had prepar himself to answer accordingli is that what you were refer to ye but sometim in the heat of a oversight hear or a courtroom or so forth you cant alwai anticip the question becaus sometim those question ar spontan is that correct that correct and so if he had a stock answer it might not have been the proper answer to a spontan question that correct and in fact that is what happen here thank you mr chairman counsel just hand you the prepar sheet that she make refer to in thi situat and youll notic that last point is on of the contenti point in the sens that that had been review and wa a part of the formal written prepar and thi is what realli she make refer to right now but i thought as she said that you ought to have the document with you mr chairman i think what you were get into is what i allud to and i think that veri import that peopl answer accordingli and if theyv got inform thei bring it out then not later right senat mack thank you mr chairman ms hanson i just want to go back to that memo on septemb thirtieth for just a moment that you had sent to mr altman where you have ask bill <unk> to keep me inform is there anyth els

provid health care at a lower cost than other privat insur plan but despit the save mani have start make big profit some peopl fear that in the futur the h m os wont be as cost effect as thei ar now and that the qualiti of care thei provid could suffer in order to protect profit npr patricia <unk> report back in the nineteen forti when h m os were first creat thei were non profit thei provid basic comprehens medic care for on price at the time thei were consid controversi even label socialist by those who oppos them but over the past ten year the number of profit make h m os in thi countri ha nearli tripl mani not for profit ar now switch to for profit statu take the case of <unk> health network it wa organ by blue cross of california a non profit organ it wa part of a major compani overhaul which began sai <unk> vice presid ron william in the mid eighti dure the that period the compani experienc veri signific loss as a result of realli not be in financi control of it busi in nineteen eighti six blue cross hire a new manag team to restructur the compani on year later it recruit william the compani went through a veri aggress process of turn itself around there wa some numer thing that were done there were new financi control put in place unfortun we end up have to make signific reduct in employe so the compani turn itself around on of the critic strategi in turn the compani around wa the decis to try to sell more low cost h m os instead of the more expens tradit health plan part of that decis wa the creation of a profit make organ to run the h m o ron william as a for profit busi you ar abl to rais capit from a varieti of sourc therefor your abl to invest in your busi to make the right invest that can produc a product for your custom at an even lower cost and therebi give your custom a veri good valu and provid a reason return to an investor ha that happen have your cost to the custom gone down ye we have found that our price ar veri competit and that the purchas volum that we have of have approxim two and on half million member here in california ha permit us to develop veri good partnership with local health care deliveri system hospit and physician and in exchang for the volum that we bring were abl to obtain substanti discount which were abl to pass on to our custom so the new emphasi on h m os prove enorm success and pull the compani out of debt in nineteen nineti two it made on hundr seventi four million dollar in profit five year earlier it had lost about that much in on year thi year <unk> stock jump from zero dollar and twenti six cent a share to zero dollar and sixti two cent in just three month some of that success ha been pass on to top execut <unk> c e o make well over on million dollar a year in salari and benefit vice presid ron william over half a million i guess i have to ask you should <unk> be pai for what some peopl might consid excess payment compens bonus at a time when what were look for as a countri ar save is that appropri i think that if you want to have an effect industri you want to have an industri that provid afford high qualiti access care you need to attract the best talent and you need to have organ that can set aggress goal and work hard to achiev those goal with talent and capabl peopl in other case the amount of monei made by h m o execut is even higher than at <unk> for exampl the c e o of the california base foundat health corpor receiv a three point five million dollar bonu last year on top of hi salari of nearli on million dollar make him the countri

troublesom to burt <unk> a state <unk> in california where there ar more h m os than anywher els in the countri <unk> ha watch the h m o movement transform itself into a profit make industri he worri that the profit motiv could interfer with h m os decis about whether to pai or not pai for medic care and if you sai no to that medic care famili want to know that it a medic judgment not an econom judgment driven by corpor profit execut compens level of return to sharehold for compani who ar trade publicli those kind of consider if theyr even part of the mix ar veri veri troubl to peopl whose famili member ar suffer from these grave ill <unk> point to a recent studi by the california medic associ which find for profit h m os spend far less monei on actual medic care than non for profit for exampl the non profit kaiser foundat health plan spend zero dollar and nineti five cent of everi dollar on actual medic care <unk> health network on the other hand spend zero dollar and sixti nine cent accord to dean witter equiti research report <unk> spent twenti percent less on medic in nineteen nineti two than it did five year earlier <unk> offici sai thei spend less becaus theyr more effici even so zero dollar and twelv cent of everi dollar goe toward profit zero dollar and eighteen cent toward advertis salari and overhead kaiser on the other hand spend onli zero dollar and three cent of everi dollar on advertis salari and overhead in fact of the ten h m os who spend the least on medic care nine ar for profit stanford univers economist alan <unk> sai the profit motiv isnt necessarili bad and that in fact it respons for enorm innov for the consum both in the gener economi and in health care the thing that protect consum the best and the thing that work best is to make the market work that is to give consum the maximum incent to choos the econom health plan and to give them the best possibl inform so that thei can choos wise and then let the competit market work becaus i think the total of human experi with econom organ tell us that market economi work best to give us new product to improv product to improv qualiti and that govern control and regul economi fail that the big lesson of the twentieth centuri where we had a worldwid competit between these two philosophi but when you bring it down to home with idea like politician lai on limit you cant more than a certain amount well that greatli destroi the incent of a compani to improv effici but skeptic still worri skeptic like doctor david <unk> who is in privat practic teach at harvard medic school and advoc a canadian like health care system <unk> sai he seen the profit motiv interfer with good medic care in the hospit industri which over the past decad ha increasingli merg consolid and establish profit make network we know that hospit dump patient who ar uninsur all the time thei take peopl with sever injuri after theyv had a neg wallet biopsi no insur card found put them in an

whole literatur about how to avoid <unk> patient and servic which kind of thing you should be do and which avoid becaus theyr not profit in fact becaus so mani privat hospit start dump patient on

worri that the profit motiv mai drive h m os to make decis that dont benefit the patient alreadi he sai it routin for h m os to tell him hi patient dont need to see higher cost specialist even when he

360,804,listen to thi composit by professor <unk> <unk> of the univers of chicago sometim it sweet and familiar at other moment it sound complet out of tune it from a new compact disc of hi work call <unk> an <unk> in sixteen note equal tune the c d also includ twelv <unk> <unk> a fanfar in nineteen note equal tune and a suit for guitar in fifteen note equal tune to understand what these micro <unk> ar imagin a piano keyboard in ani octav sai from middl c to high c there ar twelv equal step you go up seven white kei and five black kei each kei a half step awai from the next that a standard twelv tone equal tune now imagin the same octav divid into more equal step sai nine white kei and six black kei well that would make fifteen note to the octav instead of the familiar twelv each step would be smaller than a half step henc micro <unk> more and smaller step might make nineteen or twenti note equal tune music plai in ani on of these <unk> would sound differ from the music that we usual hear <unk> <unk> undertook a project some year ago on a grant from the nation endow for the human to write music in everi micro tune from thirteen step to the octav all the wai to twenti four step to the octav he came to our chicago bureau to illustr the note that you hear when he divid the octav into fifteen note now what you can hear is each on of the interv plai first the lower note and the higher note and then the two plai togeth and you can tell that in certain case the interv you hear sound rather like the on were familiar with but in other case thei sound entir differ and the first on is a littl bit alien but not extrem so now the second on a littl bigger a rather strang sound now a littl bigger a veri strang sound on that on sound familiar that on sound familiar also next on a bit twist now the next on veri weird the next on also veri weird now you got a more familiar on anoth familiar on anoth familiar on now come a strang on on that not quit as strang and then final the octav itself now when you sai that some of them sound familiar and other ar veri strang is that simpli becaus the mathemat of divid the doubl the frequenc from a note to it to on octav higher that we hit step that ar the veri same step as thei ar in the twelv tone ye in some case you do if you stop and think for a moment you can divid an octav into three equal part with either the twelv note divis or the fifteen note divis and so there ar two interv besid the octav itself in that arrai that ar in fact ident to what you hear on the piano well those ar the note that you get when you divid the octav into fifteen step instead of twelv step now i want to ask you about twenti three note tune you wrote a composit for twenti three note tune that is the last of the realli extrem alien on thi twenti three note tune when i heard it i knew it remind me of someth and it remind me a littl bit of a sound of on of these indonesian <unk> orchestra ye well there wa a theorist who a dutch theorist who live in indonesia for mani year who put forth the hypothesi in fact that the <unk> mode us in indonesia ar extract from the twenti three note equal tune now at the present time <unk> and scholar ar not persuad by hi argument but i rather am now tell me about what you wrote for nineteen tone for nineteen note you have veri <unk> <unk> and in fact thei ar more <unk> than what is found on the piano keyboard and all of the common <unk> that you find in christma carol co exist in the nineteen note scale but in even more <unk> version in other word you can just about take a manual of christma carol sit at a nineteen note equal instrument and plai them and thei sound a littl bit smoother and prettier than thei do on the piano thi is the scale in which you wrote the fanfar for the chicago radio station <unk> that right and explain to me again how can it sound smoother and <unk> than the veri <unk> for which the christma carol wa written the equal tune on the piano distort the tune of the <unk> quit notic and in fact it thi distort that a <unk> listen for when he tune a piano it to get the wrong interv wrong in exactli the right wai so in a certain sens there is an idealist or <unk> tune for a <unk> which all these equal <unk> can onli approxim and it happen rather by accid that the nineteen note <unk> is simpli closer to the ideal than the twelv note <unk> now curious enough the twelv note divis is not the onli on that ever been us throughout music histori there wa an eccentr italian intellectu who built a thirti on note equal instrument in the middl of the sixteenth centuri and in fact the standard of the twelv tone tune came about much later than ha previous been realiz id like to go back to that fifteen note equal tune and the suit for guitar that you wrote for it and that is on the compact disc that now been releas have you been present to watch audienc react to the live plai of thi piec in fifteen tone equal tune iv never seen it perform befor a larg audienc of ordinari concert goer iv seen smaller audienc on campus but jeffrei <unk> the guitarist tell me he plai the piec extens in germani and got no peculiar reaction to it at all and yet norman <unk> at <unk> tell me that on dai he plai a portion of the piec and forget to announc that it wa for fifteen note equal tune and the <unk> lit up you mean peopl peopl were call in to sai there someth wrong with the radio station or someth is terribl wrong that guitar is out of tune and to be sure in a certain sens it is out tune but then in anoth sens the ordinari twelv note guitar is out of tune also were just more accustom to that on well i must sai i found myself listen to the fifteen note tune and nod and hear it and it sound right and veri pleasant to me and then everi onc in a while a note would come in that sound as though it wa it just didnt belong there it wa some note i wa complet unfamiliar with well there ar some place in the fifteen note <unk> where i might make a slightli differ choic if i were go to undertak a revis of the piec there a coupl of place where i must confess thei disturb me also but there ar other which sound differ which i do not find disturb now curious enough when thi project wa peer review as all the n e a grant ar on of the rel sympathet peer <unk> wrote back in hi evalu that there wa a univers agreement that the <unk> of fifteen sixteen and eighteen note were of no music us whatev did you sai that wa on of the more sympathet peer <unk> that wa on of the more sympathet on and i honestli do think that i have manag to disprov hi

i dont want to <unk> thi as none of us do i think but i want the record to be complet so that we have a fair capac to understand thi senat shelbi spent a littl while and other have ask a number of time about the memorandum or diari so call of roger altman with respect to the word paralyz and the quot if we dont solv thi within the next two dai you dont have to worri about a schedul i realli want to place in the record and ask unanim consent to do so just two newspap collect of new stori begin in decemb of nineteen nineti three run up through the time of thi diari without object it will be made part of the record id just like to run through it veri quickli for a minut and then revisit the diari in that context on decemb twenti third of nineteen nineti three a newspap articl appear in the washington post and thi is just the washington post new york time here but the washington post had hill pressur build for probe of clinton whitewat deal i might add the hill pressur might more accur have been describ as republican pressur becaus it wa exclus jim leach senat damato robert dole but that wa phrase as hill pressur and on the next dai or excus me that wa the second dai the dai befor that an articl in the new york time investig to seek ex white hous <unk> file on land <unk> on the twenti fourth that the third consecut dai headlin clinton releas file on land deal and thei were all given over to the justic depart by the white hous on januari third independ counsel urg in arkansa probe g o p <unk> call rebuf and the next dai g o p leader seek counsel to probe clinton <unk> on the fourth of januari clinton continu to gather land deal file painstak disclosur process is describ so the white hous is in the midst of gather all the document pull it togeth on januari sixth white hous hope to avoid leak of clinton file it veri import to understand that thi entir thing came about through leak the law wa broken someon in the r t c broke the law and releas confidenti and there wa a clear concern about the polit of thi and what might happen on januari sixth a subpoena issu of the clinton file and the white hous to compli in the save and loan <unk> on the seventh of januari attornei gener reno to ask for special counsel in the clinton land deal i might add attornei gener reno obvious appoint by presid clinton on januari eighth presid lawyer tri to limit the us of the whitewat file to onli the justic depart in the public domain you have a report of the veri item which wa discuss in the convers that were refer to earlier so thi wa not secret thi wa a public discuss at the point of the fact that the white hous wa justifi concern about leak and polit with respect to thi on the twelfth nine democrat join in the call for a special <unk> and on the thirteenth presid clinton sought a special counsel and ask janet reno to name the counsel on the land deal now thi particular call by the democrat occur on dai after the notic wa made in the diari of roger altman so all of thi is the context within which ms william ha testifi that hillari clinton wa total consum pull togeth all of these document so id simpli want to make that context avail becaus it veri easi to sit here <unk> talk about these item that appear but when you realiz thi incred pressur and the consumpt of make sure your compli with the law pull togeth the document it seem to me that a character about paralyz we dont know if that exactli what wa said or not said but i assum from your earlier testimoni ms william you said someth to the effect that she wa spend an inordin amount of time with counsel is that fair or not in my opinion she wa spend time with counsel that should have been spent on health care well is it fair to sai she wa distract from the rest of the agenda she wa not distract but i believ that we could have been much more proactiv if the time that she wa spend on answer question press inquiri and on be talk to by her person lawyer were spent <unk> on health care she well i understand that but i mean look it seem to me that if she spend a lot of hour on someth that she didnt want to spend time on she distract that would be a fair character i mean the presid himself announc and here the wall street journal articl sai the presid is back down in an effort to protect the rest of hi agenda i mean he wa awar that thi wa invad the time and energi of the white hous and thei need to deal with it and deal with it is precis what wa mention in mr altman diari where he sai if we dont solv thi within the next two dai you dont have to worri about her schedul on health care correct im sorri could you repeat that pleas if we dont solv thi thi is read from roger altman diari if we dont solv thi within the next two dai you dont have to worri about her schedul on health care and the question is sir the question is wasnt thi in fact solv within the next two dai when the presid appoint a special counsel and turn all the document over to the justic depart oh ye i guess to some degre it wa so i mean thi it seem to me is is sort of an accur reflect of the state of affair of the time and noth inconsist with what you have testifi or what wa in fact happen at that point in time well sir if i can just make a brief point here the question with respect to the diari wa whether or not i had had these convers with mr altman and i felt in respond to the question i had to sai in all honesti that to the best of my recollect i did not have these convers with him with respect to what the mood of the white hous wa or whether or not hi diari reflect the mood i wont speak to that but i will sai that the question were did you have these convers with mr altman and i must sai that to the best of my recollect i did not that is not to sai that mr altman could have been read the newspap look at what wa in the public domain and come to these thing himself i am sai that i did not have these convers with mr altman to the best my recollect and your sai that you had no at thi meet on health care you made no comment to him at all about the degre to which hillari clinton wa wrap up in thi or involv or couldnt be involv in the health care schedul what i said and excus me what i said wa to the best of my recollect i did not have these specif convers with mr altman as reflect by hi word and hi write but what i also did volunt to thi committe wa that i had been sai to anyon who would listen that i believ whitewat wa a distract from the presid agenda and i did not understand how seventeen year of arkansa histori wa relat to feed peopl cloth peopl give peopl health care i wa outspoken i said that i said it over and over and you might have said it to mr altman it is possibl he could have heard me sai that thank you veri much thank you senat kerri mr chairman ye senat damato i want to just indic senat moselei braun ha not yet had a chanc and will want to take on same thing with senat domenici yeah senat domenici youv not had a round yet either have you all right so we have two member who need to do that senat damato mr chairman im go to yield i just want to make an observ i think senat kerri ha done us a great servic in put forth the fact of all of those thing in the public domain which were absolut of tremend consequ and take tremend time of the administr suggest it wasnt given the litani and it wa public now mr altman tell us under oath mr altman sai under oath that hi diari accur reflect hi discuss with you maggi william he said hi duti hi diari includ entri which had histor signific in other word thi wasnt just a collect of thing histor signific and were intend to be accur now im go to ask you a question ar you sai that mr altman testimoni is inaccur sir what im sai to you is i am also under oath here and as i have said befor i do not have a recollect of these convers so then he mai have been accur and he testifi to us that thei were written for histor signific and intend to be accur now you sai you dont have a recollect now it is not now that i sai no i dont mean to be well you tell me no it is not now that i have said i have consist said even to mr altman himself that i do not have a recollect of have ani of these convers with you okai i thank you mr chairman let me just try to clarifi here i dont think anybodi try to make ani big deal out of thi thing but here the point youv got a person like mr altman who is write in a confidenti diari that he assum at the time is never go to be read by anybodi and he sai not that he read someth in the newspap but on whitewat maggi told me that hillari rodham clinton wa paralyz by it now twice under oath he gone back and verifi it and you know obvious the natur thing is to wonder why in the world anybodi would make the entri thei never thought anybodi would read at risk of perjuri defend it twice and then have it turn out in the recollect of someon who ha alreadi said i dont go around talk about the ladi i work for and i assum if you did it be a pretti extraordinari convers and obvious mr altman thought thi on wa but that where the confus here is come from and it just on of these deal where you got two peopl and thei have two differ stori let me sai mack i want to come and ask you a question and it just it someth im confus about and iv tri to go back and put all thi togeth and understand what wa go on and i read from all of these intern diari which i give greater credenc to becaus peopl wrote them from their heart thei assum thei were never go to be read and when we sai thing publicli we know thei ar go to be read and as human we all have the tendenc to at least put it in the best light for us if not put it in a light that is brighter than the sun in ani case all through thi period we have these refer in these diari about intens pressur that altman wa under from the white hous that he had been told by the white hous that step asid in the madison investig wa quot unaccept these ar power word that peopl gener dont make up or confus with other word now last night the presid brought into thi discuss a whole new perspect when he said the onli thing that upset me thi is about altman decid to take himself out of the madison guaranti investig the onli thing that upset me wa that i did not want to see him <unk> into it now here is the point were read what mr altman is sai in hi diari what hi <unk> the chief of staff is sai in hi diari and there ar at least all the pressur is from the white hous to stai on in the investig where is thi why do you think the presid ha reach a conclus that there thi pressur <unk> him to get out of it it seem to me that you could make a case base on what we know wa in mr altman mind and in the mind of the peopl around him that all of hi peer said you ought to get out of it your on of the presid closest friend youv got thi long connect from be in colleg peopl ar go to at least sai that there a potenti conflict of interest here with your friend we know that but in term of pressur as he perceiv it it all come from on direct from the white hous and it all to stai in the madison investig explain to me if you can where the presid see thi pressur on him to stamped him to leav the madison investig and to take himself out of it senat if i understand your question let me try to respond to it as best i possibl can as iv alreadi comment thi morn and testifi i dont know of ani evid to suggest that mr altman had pressur or intens pressur to recus himself i certainli did not convei that to him i think the presid comment probabl is in the context and mr nussbaum and other can discuss thi more fulli i believ mr klein and mr <unk> did yesterdai in their panel there were a number of other nomine that were befor variou committe and thi matter of <unk> if you had ani relationship with the presid wa an issu and that realli wa a veri seriou issu and on i think particularli mr nussbaum wa concern about do you let me just ask you your opinion on someth if i mai if it appropri do you believ given the close associ with the presid that mr altman should have <unk> himself which again i try to speak in the languag of the peopl who ar listen that he should have taken himself out of the madison investig from dai on my opinion is that mr altman had all the fact to make that decis he should make that decis you character hi relationship with the presid it not unusu to have a relationship i dont think perhap the relationship is as close and long stand as perhap you suggest but i think mr altman been a person at least in my deal that alwai been even hand and object and if he reach a conclus he could be in thi matter then that wa hi decis senat and i think that what he wa weigh well i think that that correct i guess i would have to go back to the point and sai let me just pick a real life exampl iv known senat domenici sinc i came to congress were not childhood friend i never borrow ani monei from him but if i found myself in a posit where i had to decid about thing like crimin referr with relationship to my friend senat domenici or if i found myself have to overse an investig of him and im confid that i or no on els will ever be in that posit which is why i chose him i think immedi without give it a thought as long as a heartbeat i would sai look mayb i can be object but i think peopl ar go to question whether i could be object or not and i wouldnt it wouldnt take a second to sai i want to in the legal word recus myself from thi but yet we have thi long tortur process with all of thi pressur be report in privat for him to stai on no pressur record in privat for him to leav and it just strike me as a strang logic and obvious i dont understand the logic the presid express here that he wa concern that altman wa be forc to withdraw himself from the investig when it seem to me that there thi overwhelm pressur for him to stai in it and there should have never been ani real doubt in anybodi mind that he shouldnt have not gotten it in gotten into it to begin with do you have a respons mr mclarti the time ha run but do you have a respons you want to make to that ye veri quickli pleas do ye first the testimoni ha been that there wa not pressur appli so i would like on thi decis so i would like to respond to that secondli i recal an exchang a brief exchang between mr klein and senat bennett last night i believ about thi <unk> matter and peopl can look at thi matter differ to me mr altman wa the person who could know in hi gut i think as senat bennett said whether he could be object and fair and i think if he conclud that he would inde feel that wai and would be object and fair i think that a decis that each individu ha to make senat well we mai have to come back to that senat moselei braun thank you mr chairman like a dog with a bone texa republican senat phil gramm ha been push the question of roger altman delai in decid to separ himself from the decis make on madison guaranti,

366,816,were still wait for court to begin todai the hear to suppress some on hundr plu item of evid in the possess of the prosecut the defens ha rais the motion theyv also subpoena some twenti wit among them two of the prosecutor in thi case marcia clark and william hodgman the attornei ar in chamber at thi moment with the judg presum fight that subpoena roger cossack first to you how much of what weve been hear in the past few dai specif the interview that weve seen with the victim famili how much of that is plai for the benefit of potenti juror well i think it more than coincid that these kind of interview occur just when the juri select is about to begin i think all of thi is orchestr and i think it done quit a bit for the potenti juror to gather sympathi for both side we know that recent there been interview with mr simpson children and we know that also the famili of the goldman mr goldman ha been on televis you know i think thi is a concert effort so that peopl who ar come in on that juri will either have sympathi on wai or the other greta van susteren the other dai in court judg ito us an interest word to describ potenti juror he want to see how mani of them had been contamin in your opinion how mani potenti juror have been contamin by media coverag so far well jim a lot ar go to come into thi courtroom with an opinion on the evid but what the judg is go to sai to them is can you disregard the opinion that you have arriv at base on the inform youv heard in the media and a good juror a juror who got an honest heart and soul is go to sai ye i can disregard what iv heard i have heard a lot i have form an opinion but when i walk through thi door im go to abandon that and decid thi case onli on what i hear in the courtroom and i believ that can be done it take a lot of hard work but a good honest citizen can do that now were nearli on the ev of juri select the issu of sequestr come up and accord to on publish report on third of the five hundr potenti juror survei said that it would be a burden for them if thei were sequest till februari how much could that impact thi case and the juri select and the timelin that were talk about well the biggest problem jim is that it elimin a number of peopl from that potenti pool of juror the peopl who can serv usual on a sequest juri ar either those who ar unemploi or retir or fabul rich or have employ who ar will to pai their salari in spite of the fact that thei will not be at work theyr go to be on a juri that a real problem that elimin a lot of peopl peopl who work in store who work in ga station who run their own busi thei will not be includ in thi pool and when you select a juri youd like a cross section of the popul roger cossack thi case ha been liter on a fast track so far ar you expect to see those wheel of justic grind to a halt as we await the select of a juri i dont think theyr go to grind to a halt but theyr certainli go to slow down but id just like to follow up on the sequestr question i am shock that it onli a report on third that said thei cant do it that mean that there two third of these over a thousand peopl that theyr interview who could afford to spend six month lock up in a hotel perhap up to six month lock up in a hotel room decid thi case i dont think i know anybodi who either could or would do such a thing now in addit to the motion to suppress that it go to be heard todai cathi randa o j simpson assist is expect to be call about shred a document that polic want to get their hand on prosecutor want to get their hand on how seriou ar the alleg that cathi randa mai have knowingli shred a certain document well there a big differ jim between appear of improprieti and ani time anyon goe out and shred a document that the polic want it ha the appear of improprieti wa it illeg number there wa no warrant demand that she produc it she wa realli free to do exactli what she want with it it mai appear improp and mai shed and we mai all be curiou and all of a sudden veri suspici about what go on but probabl what she did wa no illeg well there mai not have been a warrant but polic investig clearli want that document and accord to the prosecutor marcia clark the other dai in court cathi randa knew that thei want that document but the thing is jim that you pick up the phone you call the magistr you sai magistr we have inadvert stumbl upon thi addit document while we were execut thi search warrant we would like a telephon warrant so we can secur it thei didnt do that thei wait sever dai thei should have done someth right then and there greta dont you believ that thi realli indic how littl trust there is now between the prosecut and the defens in thi kind of situat becaus normal even though you fight like the <unk> in the courtroom thi is the kind of thing that perhap can be handl by a phone call particularli if it as innoc as the defens claim it is but i think the prosecut just furiou about the fact thi even if it an innoc document wa shred becaus it a sort of in your face act by the defens and i just think the prosecut furiou and you know if i wa the prosecutor on thi case whether it an innoc document or not i would be in front of the judg on thi too i would be realli angri roger i dont disagre with you obvious i would be furiou as well but you have to look at the histori of thi case there is a lot of antagon that ha been grow on both side and both side need to be alert thi is a combat thi is a war thei cant sit and trust the other side theyr both fight for their client which theyr suppos to and as long as thei dont have agreement in which thei have previous agre that theyr go to preserv evid and do whatev it is that thei want to to make thi a more <unk> process thei must be alert the glove have come off and theyv got to work hard to try to protect themselv now the camera in the courtroom is not yet on but we understand that cathi randa and her attornei ar in court in the front row,

talk about civil war as the <unk> and basebal as the odyssei well the the civil war defin us mani peopl sai that it the great epic battl that defin our nation made it what it is todai and therefor the the war the civil war ha been call the american <unk> i have chosen to focu on basebal as a wai to understand the countri we becam not as a metaphor as much as a mirror that basebal reflect all our tendenc walt whitman felt thi right at the time of the civil war he said it fit into our life as significantli as our <unk> somehow he saw someth in thi game and it a combin of lot of factor it a commun game mm hm you have to plai it togeth it a beautifulli design game unlik ani other game the defens ha the ball right there no clock peopl score not the ball score all of these thing kind of conspir to make it a a literari game why have poet and writer and everyon been drawn to thi game if there isnt someth in it initi construct that appeal and then sinc it ha accompani our narr for two hundr year yeah we can tie and measur the benchmark of our own person life and our larger nation life by what go on you know it you know the great moment when when justic potter stewart is hand a note in the suprem court and it sai <unk> fli to left agnew resign that basebal it had the prioriti did it here is what walt whitman said well it our game that the chief fact in connect with it america game it ha the snap go <unk> of the american atmospher it belong as much to our institut fit into them as significantli as our constitut law it just as import in the sum total of our histor life it did it chang how ha it chang and and why in thi film have you focus so much on the central of race in the evolut of basebal thi is our central stori as a countri we ar found more than two hundr year ago on the most nobl principl yet advanc in humankind that all men ar creat equal yet the men who distil the essenc of the <unk> and put it into that magnific sentenc own slave mm and four score and seven year ago we fought a war and kill two percent of our popul and still didnt decid ultim in the heart and mind of american men and women that there wa all men were creat equal and so it becom the central thread and if you ar interest in know as i am what make our countri tick who we ar then you have to see that race is the central thing as you look at basebal basebal finest moment is when jacki robinson come up it is the first progress in civil right sinc the civil war and it occur not where we think these thing occur it occur on the diamond of our so call nation pastim and as you begin to dig a littl bit further you find out that two year after two percent of our popul di supposedli settl the issu the all black <unk> team of philadelphia not a southern team of philadelphia ar deni membership in the nation associ of basebal player and from then on we have exclud or found a wai to exclud or to punish african american in basebal in much the same wai we have punish them in our larger societi so by in a <unk> sens where you could find the univers in a grain of sand you studi basebal you studi ourself take a look at thi clip thi is jacki robinson entri into major leagu

your blue in the face but realli it come down to veri power emot that connect me to you and mm to other about time about memori about famili and about home and jacki stori seem to add thi central american fault line about race to it and doe it magnific he wa ask by branch rickei as you know to turn the other cheek for three year for three year in the face of wither wither racial insight insult

batter he brought the flavor of the negro leagu game to basebal but he did it carri on hi shoulder thi remark burden thei put black cat on the field theyd scream at him theyd lai open their hi thigh with their spike and he essenti set the tone and the charact of the upcom civil right movement a combin of forbear but also a sens of milit that it wa go to come around no man ha ever plai the game who plai it with more digniti more digniti as he did can you imagin have to hold it in peopl have said you cant you cant plai basebal angri you have to be relax and here a man have to hold in everyth he on of the great stori i mean gerald earli who the head of the african american studi depart at washington univers in saint loui sai you can measur american histori befor robinson and after robinson it that much of a sea chang and we sai oh thi occur in our game well thi game is a fantast intersect of fact the statist who won yeah lost and metaphor what it mean i mean that what a game is interest hi wife in the stand who aliv and live here in new york had to stand and shield him she she had she had promis branch rickei that she would wa also under the same constraint and she couldnt yell she couldnt defend her husband and can you imagin thi rel small woman sit in the stand feel the anger be hurl at her husband i mean the focu of we cant even appreci how bad it wa and hope somehow that her bodi would intercept that she could widen out far enough if that isnt a symbol of of of hi great and her i dont know what is for you jacki robinson is the greatest player becaus of all thi not onli a great player but becaus of what he i think he a real hero and how a true hero yeah you make the point actual in convers that that there is a differ in celebr yeah who doe someth well on an athlet field and a true hero who robinson did someth well on the athlet field and wa celebr for it but carri a much deeper and stronger we confus in our societi celebr and heroism you know theyr veri veri differ there ar basebal hero the men who know how to hit the ball joe <unk> and willi mai and babe ruth and lou gehrig and yet there ar peopl who who take their great skill as basebal player and add someth more and that a jacki robinson that a kurt flood that a christi <unk> and a lou gehrig at time that a branch rickei where thei ar call on to do someth that is not expect of them it a ted william who when he is induct into the hall of fame in hi first year of elig stand up there and sai i would like to see satchel <unk> and josh gibson here and thei ar not here becaus thei did not get a chanc that heroism when in hi moment of glori when the greatest hitter who ever live could quit rightfulli bask in hi own accomplish he took the time to speak up for those who were not spoken for and then help initi the move toward the inclus of negro leagu player in the hall of fame you mention ted william let talk a littl bit about some of the other great hero that ar in thi film and a part of the american histori and a part of basebal <unk> cobb he is the man that some sai is the greatest player ever to plai the game he mai who saw hi record broken by pete rose who brought some sens of scandal to the game he is the most interest person that i got to know in the cours of thi seri terrifi he like jacki is got to know in term of he dead but you got to know him becaus in the wai you get to know abraham lincoln someon told me that what i do is i wake the dead ye and i think it must be for my own person reason but somehow when you work on a project like thi you get to know these peopl and feel like you know them cobb and robinson both come from rural georgia both have terrif temper and there the similar end the black man jacki robinson make the most heroic gestur in the histori of basebal <unk> cobb just wa a bundl of anger virul racism and it wa with him hi whole life and yet it produc great basebal and final at the end you sai at what cost but he is he <unk> up page after page of histori where do you come down when you mention someon like <unk> cobb becaus he is often part of a footnot to thi stori pete rose and whether he should be in the hall of fame somehow we and the broad sens of media have becom so sanctimoni like the coloni elder who paint the scarlet letter a how could we possibl deni pete rose despit all of hi problem and hi foibl and hi fault entri into the hall of fame if we were to do that we need to retroact go back and take out babe ruth we certainli have to take out <unk> cobb and probabl half the member wouldnt surviv a kind of sanctimoni and moralist scrutini that we appli now put pete rose in im glad if if a juri of hi peer found him guilti of tax evas and whatev it is he goe to jail and pai for that crime but let honor him for someth which is he ha more hit do you think your point of view repres the the major opinion of peopl who will vote for hi elect into the hall of fame i hope it chang i think there there a littl bit of discomfort i im begin to perceiv that i hope that eventu hell come in becaus we cant the hall of fame cant be an <unk> of moral charact it ha to be an <unk> of basebal excel i would as who did you want to talk to that not among the seventi joe <unk> i think why did he sai no well i just think he wa sort of <unk> i mean we made the usual inquiri and and you had all the peopl who could get to him

lefti <unk> himself a pitcher face the eighteen year old bobbi <unk> the first on came over and the umpir call a strike and the second on came over he call a strike and the third on came over the umpir call a strike and <unk> said i thought that last on sound a littl low alwai look for hero alwai the peopl look up to see someth that repres them that is larger than thei ar and if it perfect that thei might becom as a young boi when i wa taken to my first game at yanke stadium my god yanke stadium talk about awesom sight to see joe <unk> whose name had that happi combin of <unk> that mine

is thrown out dewei evan make a spectacular catch and all of a sudden it come up and and carlton fisk step up to the plate yeah and hit thi home run which we know hi bodi <unk> fair for that wa as dan <unk> said a <unk> moment that brought mani peopl back to the nation pastim what about the music in the film well it on sever layer it got the tradit relationship to music that iv alwai enjoi which is take the old folk music in thi case mani old basebal tune that we discov at the hall of fame and rearrang them but it is also becaus we cover so much territori a histori of american music from parlor music to jazz to dixieland duke ellington lester young earli rock and roll r and b hard rock and how mani time do we hear take me out to the ball game we must hear it sixti or seventi time from cocktail music to new version by carli simon to amaz amaz upbeat version septemb twenti sixth is seventh in nineteen fifti nineteen sixti the capitol of basebal celebr the domin of new york citi basebal well i wa edit and i realiz that the fifti i wa go to call it the best that ever wa becaus now with the black player up there i feel that the game wa the best it ever wa begin then but i realiz that it wa all about new york and suddenli i decid to turn what seem to be basebal wa about new york then it wa about new york and the giant and the yanke and the dodger wrote basebal histori year in and year out and did so with an an import that im begin to appreci onli now when you think that when the dodger and giant far left someth went out of the citi it certainli went out of brooklyn and were look for what that extra thing is the ident that a team bring a town in a wai that we dont feel now who ar the contemporari player those that ar plai the game now who ar in the film veri veri few we the last in is call home and it goe from nineteen seventi to the right present and we have willi <unk> and the and and pete rose and some of the scandal and we realli slow down thi thing im in a im a historian i do or an amateur historian and i dont like to to deal with the journalist recent past but we go right up to the carter and the toronto blue <unk> win the world seri and make it truli a world seri between two countri and not on yeah and sort of <unk> that in i dont want to make judgment about them i think the new i think the game right now ha never been better why do you sai that i i think were see talent equal to anyth weve ever seen befor like <unk> and and thoma thoma and william i think were see great pitch rememb weve gone through an era of parodi like we have never seen the last twenti year weve onli seen a coupl of repeat minnesota and and and toronto and there wa on ye ten year period when it wa a differ team everi year and last place team would come to to first great pitcher like <unk> you know maddux i mean thi is a great great period which make the pain of the current labor stuff all the more poignant for me we obvious ar not go to have basebal thi year were not go to have a world seri and some sai that we probabl wont see basebal if at all next year until after the mid season break what is it that bring you the most pain to know that charli <unk> said that basebal wa the background music of america and i want more than anyth for the seri to go out with the proof of the pud in the fact that even if you said oh well im not interest in the team im go to turn on the game that you could find in the moment of the game the intersect the interv and thi is a game dan <unk> said about ponder inact as you look at the pitcher mm hm what doe he have to throw thi gui or where ar the <unk> go to posit themselv where is the cutoff it ha a differ pace than ani other sport noth els that as you ponder thi inact that the proof of what im try to sai about the game is there and that i miss it you know boswel said the six month of the year tom boswel of the washington post he said the six month of the year when there basebal it just a littl bit better there someth more in our live i feel that too i mean i wa yesterdai i wa sit in a diamond next to a diamond in virginia talk to somebodi a report who didnt realli care about basebal that much and there wa a practic go on and i felt a tidal pull to get into it and i said you know i i have to let you know that my bodi is be drawn into thi game that i want not to so much watch i want to get out there youv had the joi of throw out the first ball that onc or twice or about eight time so why do you get to do it it thi so much i mean well weve been on thi tour yeah and and and to stand on the mound in a <unk> do we have a videotap of that i will find you on i mean do you ye learn final to get it right yeah well the first time i threw a perfect strike and the catcher just went huh yeah and he walk out he sai that the first strike iv had all year becaus there ar the usual <unk> right like ken burn out there right right bounc the pitch and the next dai i got cocki at jacob field and i bounc the ball the next dai at memori sta jacob field is <unk> is cleveland it cleveland it a right beauti field new then i wa in counti stadium in milwauke and iv been throw strike more or less buck sai doe buck go with you to throw these strike yeah <unk> buck wa at the best moment of thi summer is that i threw out the first ball on august third at royal stadium when the royal dan <unk> the uniform of the nineteen twenti four champion kansa citi monarch and even the scoreboard said the athlet versu the monarch and thei plai in the baggi pant of yeah wool uniform and thei brought back all these old monarch to celebr and i threw out the first pitch to buck talk about some of the myth of basebal for exampl judg <unk> who in a sens came on and gave basebal some integr after the scandal also is portrai here as as a man with clai feet tardi on civil right beyond belief it is hi death that allow in mani wai robinson to advanc yeah benjamin chandler happi chandler right becom the commission and he realiz that if you can die at <unk> <unk> and okinawa you can plai major leagu basebal yeah after the second world war and for those year <unk> did noth to help and other than the sheer sens of of the signific of it and and and the <unk> of it and the moral of it and the justic of it how did african american chang the game oh in everi wai and you know we tradition even when we feel sympathet toward an african american histori in our kind of typic patron attitud we alwai <unk> it into some black histori month right right and still <unk> it still <unk> it and what we want to do in thi wa to integr it from the veri first in on thei plai a differ kind of game that wa about speed about yeah intellig about bunt about mess up the pitcher robert <unk> describ watch robinson walk in that first year and then manufactur a run all by himself by <unk> the pitcher by take long lead and then by the time the pitcher throw back walk till final the third baseman is be call over to hold robinson on third yeah and he said iv never seen that never seen it thi is on of the david halberstam in hi book octob nineteen sixti four fabul book talk about how the saint loui cardin repres the new of basebal becaus in the nation leagu you had more african american bob gibson and and other who right and kurt flood and kurt flood whod made that team and then thei come in that seri against the new york yanke who repres you know the old the old wai the old stori <unk> and also power hit ye with mantl and <unk> versu the new speed of the cardin with with lou brock for exampl that right now plai for the cardin and that wa a transit too in basebal the singl most import statist iv come across and im not wed to statist i love the number of basebal but im not wed to it is that in the year after robinson arriv black won the m v p in the nation leagu nine out of the next eleven year yeah now if that doe not sai and that when there just a trickl even in the nation leagu if that doesnt sai what we were withhold we cannot call it the nation pastim doe it have the same appeal todai to those young athlet whether theyr black or white or or hispan or asian american hispan we open our ninth in with the <unk> who plai in upper manhattan with a furi and a fever that would beli all the <unk> about yeah the death of basebal it not as popular but i think basebal alwai had these wave i have two daughter who we read the box score we plai basebal and catch everi dai we love to go to game and as on <unk> report i will tell you that there noth diminish in the affect of for basebal in our nat befor we go i thi is an introduct to thi film and were show it as our last clip but it is about what thi game is about take a look at thi with thi extraordinari aerial shot of night basebal here it is ted william ted probabl for the last time in a boston uniform in thi ball park there a drive to deep right center thi mai be gone fred were you back there watch home run ted william <unk> wind and fire <unk> land a base hit into center field <unk> around second he will score to tie two to two low and o deliveri to fisk he swing long drive left field if it stai there it gone home run the red sox win and the seri is ti three game apiec the first thing about it and thi seem so obviou that mayb we overlook it basebal is a beauti thing it more beauti in an old park that <unk> and quirki but even and i hate to sai thi becaus it might encourag them but even in a dome with artifici turf it beauti the wai the field fan out the <unk> of the sport the pace and rhythm of it the fact that that pace and rhythm allow for convers and reflect and opinion and comparison it a pastim someth you do it entertain someth you watch and it share experi someth you you talk about and read about and and that marvel but you can appli those same three criteria to other thing what make basebal special is that it the best game that ever been devis when you look at that and you appreci the love and the beauti and and all the <unk> of it bart <unk> to me wa a hero ye and somebodi who love the game and could articul with a great eloqu the game we were go to interview him just after he got back from hi vacat after the rose incid right wa pass and then we lost him then he had a heart attack that you us to talk about the the fact that it wa plai outdoor in the sun and the sky and the green and and then the <unk> of the whole thing and all of that on more time becaus if there been some critic and i want you to respond to it is thi notion that that it is as whitman said a game it our game that the chief fact in connect with it america game ba ba ba ba ba is it possibl to read too much into the histori of basebal that it doe that that it is not the civil war oh it is most definit not the it a game it is definit a game but game ar a wonder and particularli thi game is sort of the no drama of our cultur it where we plai out a lot of our fantasi im veri happi to have bill <unk> have the ball go between hi leg yeah and not mine and i invest thing with import and all iv tri to do is not so m wait wait you didnt mind or bill <unk> didnt mind or or oh he or million of red sox fan didnt mind i i die when i see thi still ye but im i prefer it to happen to him right we can invest it we can we get too silli about it but what i think weve done is said if you look at thi game it reflect ourselv back to ourselv we can read whatev we want there ar level to look at basebal and there ar level to look at thi seri it is eighteen and a half hour of the game of basebal if you <unk> a littl bit between the edg come mani of these social theme of race of labor of immigr of women of citi if you <unk> a littl bit farther you you begin to feel thi tidal movement of emot that reflect some of our our feel jacqu <unk> the columbia univers right scholar said whoever want to know the heart and mind of america had better learn basebal i agre what about women in basebal thei have tri to plai and have been essenti exclud at the highest profession level for a long time alta weiss in the first decad of thi centuri plai semi profession ball and wa so skill at it that her father eventu bought her a barnstorm team of all star renam it the weiss all star and she wa fabul the all american girl leagu and you know what in our lifetim we will see a woman plai in the major leagu shell be a pitcher and shell throw mostli break ball but she will be in the major leagu and then we will truli have a nation pastim yeah i also mean thi in a larger wai too what about the appeal of a thi film or b basebal to women i made it for the woman who sai boi i love the civil war film but basebal basebal and i said but you like militari histori and thei sai no thi is about life lesson and tragedi and classic confront and a sens of who we ar as a peopl that all thi is it the continu of that stori it the sequel who said histori had to be war and gener and presid we could find the same stori of the last on hundr thirti year sinc the civil war in the write of women in furnitur in architectur and im sai on wai to see it is in basebal and when you studi it and you do it in a wai that sympathet i

i had kept in check i realiz that i could i that i find a certain pleasur in the game of basebal that is indescrib and that i could take it back in and reinvest it that wa part of seventi five wa for me realiz i didnt have to for whatev polit reason of of the war in vietnam and countercultur i didnt need to get rid of thi game that had given me so much pleasur as a boi and and i think what iv done is in each success wave as we pass through the film is i deepen my love for the game take me on more time your mother had cancer my mother had cancer and i wa awar of it from you know three or four year old and what and so you were you you had the pain of her cancer i wa just i wa a littl boi unabl to have a childhood i wa i wa suddenli a young man an adult and i had to be strong and there were veri few place where you could still be a kid she di when i wa eleven and even then that didnt stop becaus you had to continu be strong and basebal wa on of the place where you could just be a kid do you think that experi somehow made you do what you do now absolut i rememb when she wa dy i us to listen to the the dog and the fire hose in selma and get incred anxiou and so i brought in from left field the cancer of race that wa wa kill my countri and thei and tri to obscur the cancer that wa <unk> my famili and that why im so concern not just with wake the dead mm but with try to find that that stream where our promis might intersect with our realiti and i believ as a republ we will have the greatest redempt as a nation if we can ever find the solut to thi question of race of why peopl

374,830,thi is weekend edit im alex <unk> isnt true that someon come in from out of town and your show them around and thei notic all the stuff that get by you you us to see it mayb but you dont anymor the wai the hill roll sai or the <unk> blue the neighbor chose for the front door of their place the person from awai see differ and hear differ too that tune wa record and publish more than thirti year ago in northwest louisiana in shreveport by a littl compani call ram record no on heard much of thi music late or of ram either it went out of the record busi decad ago now a long time fan of <unk> and rhythm and blue and the louisiana mix of flavor an englishman name rai top ha assembl the first of what ar to be sever ram record <unk> and thi first on is call shreveport stomp the ram stori is all the more remark rai top note becaus forti year ago in shreveport the onli music busi wa a radio show call the louisiana <unk> which launch start like hank william and elvi preslei and mani mani other but as soon as thei got famou thei went elsewher and if it would be tough for anyon to start a record label in shreveport it wa tougher still in thi case becaus the founder of ram record wa <unk> smith a guitar player a singer a songwrit and a woman rai top talk with us from our studio in london it wa veri unusu for a woman to be run a record compani and i dont think a lot of the peopl like the distributor and other peopl sort of thought she wa seriou like you know and i think that stood in the wai quit a bit it wasnt anyth to do with the qualiti of the music how did she find these artist to record well first of all she would hand pick peopl what appear on the louisiana <unk> and then later on she then decid to go out on sort of field trip and shed go to place like south louisiana and that where she discov roi perkin on of my favorit on the label wa thi a hit wa thi song a hit no no i mean in fact bob dart never actual got releas at the time <unk> put it out in the earli seventi on a special ram releas and she put an <unk> in on of the record magazin sai you can get these <unk> or <unk> of some old ram materi and that how you heard about it that how i heard about it id seen thi <unk> that she wa sell them for you know a dollar a piec i think and sent me monei off for that how is it that you found an affin and love for thi music and came over here and kind of rediscov ram well i think it all stem from grow up in england dure the late fifti and i wa a big fan of rock n roll when it emerg in england you know and we heard all the american record like elvi and jerri lee lewi and it wa realli my love of the music from the state and particularli the southern state somehow that feel there on those record out of the southern state which is often lack in the record from sai new york and place did ram record ever have a real hit what the biggest song thei did well i would sai probabl <unk> sam by t v slim which obvious sold pretti well becaus she cut the origin version which is on thi c d and then chess got hold of it for distribut and thei said could you go and record it again becaus thei thought it wa a littl bit it could be <unk> up a bit more so she went down to new orlean and got it <unk> again with fat <unk> band and then it lost momentum becaus the origin version which is on thi c d wa get all the action around texa louisiana yeah it got a great kind of energi in it doesnt it ye and see what happen is when thei <unk> it it wa a more faster version more <unk> version but it didnt have the <unk> of the first version did ani of the peopl that <unk> smith discov go on to be big star i dont think anybodi on the label there actual went on to be a bigger star i mean i think it is a situat again ram just didnt have that clout to get it all around america but see the other thing is alex you got to realiz is that dure that fifti period payola plai a big import part in the record busi in get artist heard yeah in get artist heard ye you had to be abl to pai to get the plai on the air and <unk> smith and ram record thei were just too littl too littl she couldnt afford that payola which some of the big northern compani were pai out you know to disc <unk> and consequ your stuff just got you know she would send them off to billboard for review she would have sent them to differ radio station but unless you had that clout that why the record never got plai enough or plai at all by certain radio station what about a song like red bean and rice what happen to that well that on again as far as i know didnt go anywher it mai have got some local radio plai in louisiana but as far as my knowledg goe it didnt get anywher at the time which is strang veri strang you know what strang listen to you and listen to thi music is that someon who is so obvious not an american mai have discov these treasur of american music and restor them to us ye i you know i like to think iv gone a long wai to be do that in england here we sort of probabl put a lot more effort into sort of discov american music than probabl the american do now thei ar get in onto it a bit more now in the state but i mean weve been do thi now for about fifteen year and it still you know we still got lot more thing to find still iv got a list as long as your arm of more label to pick up im still current check out a few more peopl down south with some amaz record so it not go to be the end of it rai top in london talk about hi latest compil of music shreveport stomp from ac record listen to thi c d in an offic at npr with the door open and speaker

and chess record and it wa particularli tough for a woman margaret lewi sai even on as determin as <unk> smith it wa difficult but it wa also a lot of fun you know have a studio get to go in and experi with the music and work with all the differ musician and singer and peopl that were pass through or live in shreveport at the time and unfortun the <unk> close down in nineteen sixti so shreveport becam music an <unk> town for mani year nashvil of cours went just the opposit thei promot the music there and it becam of cours a record center peopl were go up to the grand ol <unk> and

to blockbust blockbust look like it wasnt go to happen ye it did what made it happen well i think we made it happen weve had realli a singular vision in sinc we acquir viacom as you will rememb that wasnt easi it wa a relentless battl the fight for paramount wa a relentless battl and we relentlessli refus to let the blockbust merger die becaus our vision wa to creat the singl unparallel global media powerhous in the world and we did it with that modest goal in mind the idea that a lot of peopl were express wa that paramount ye blockbust no wayn <unk> express reserv that actual you on thi program the last time we talk said you didnt care whether realli effect number i rememb what i said you ask me a question and i said can i waffl you <unk> veri well but how critic is the blockbust compon to the powerhous that youv creat it not critic in the sens that we would have been in ani dire strait without it but on the other hand it a terrif franchis i mean it uniqu in that it got just over you know four thousand store on a worldwid basi you know it the domin retail it got great growth add to that sort of artifact in the largest custom of hollywood the largest custom of the record label great manag still tremend growth ahead of them and when you put our exist balanc sheet togeth which we were de leverag with the garden sale were talk about a cabl sale with their balanc sheet which wa realli quit strong you result in you know the combin balanc sheet that give us a lot of financi strength and flexibl if there anyth els to do go forward i might just add to that that with blockbust we i think get someth that no other media compani ha and that is direct access to the consum on a retail level and that just provid us with on other wai to drive the growth of our product whatev thei mai be whether it movi televis book game video so we think that it allow us great strateg valu to us other than the financi benefit to the compani well that that valu is sheer domin in it

the park to the publish and so on and with blockbust you have a pretti focus oper so i think the problem that we face in connect with integr blockbust ar far less than those that we face with

had a good relationship we becam veri good friend we spent a lot of time togeth a lot ha been made of the romant involv but i think more should be made of the friendship that develop out of that if you hear some click there is bad weather where keith is and keith ha been bombard a lot so were not go to tell you where he is but there is bad weather where he is the press ha been after you right keith ye thei have o k when you met her thei were separ but not divorc that is true o k and you ar the person who wa mention on the nine hundr eleven tape by o j ye i believ so yeah how did that make you feel i wa shock by it i had no knowledg of it until it wa publicli air on t v recent in other word nicol had never told you about the incid no she did not o k were you shock when you heard your name mention ye i wa but wa it true were you with nicol in a compromis posit that o j saw well id rather not go into that right now id like to address a few other issu if i could but id rather not talk about anyth as far as o k thi is not a court o k all right but you dont but you were romant involv with her that is ye i wa all right and you were confront but youv testifi befor the grand juri alreadi right ye i did and will you testifi in the trial that i believ is up to the prosecut o k what about nicol we be led wrongli im sorri larri what publicli in the tabloid or wherev ar we get to be that is a misread of nicol about nineti five percent of everyth youv read in the tabloid is misinform about nicol nineti five percent that would be my estim she wa not thi wild crazi parti girl as far as the alleg of drug and crazi parti it just not true and anybodi who make those alleg obvious did not know her i believ these ar peopl that ar spur by a differ reason other than friendship to come forward with these alleg what reason do you think possibl monetari gain possibl public it a media circu everybodi know that now there go to be a book come by fai reznick and everyon sai fai reznick wa veri close to nicol true well she wa a friend of nicol that true but i have not read the book obvious and nor will i i just dont believ there anyth in the book from what iv heard about it that interest me well if she wa a friend might the book not be veri favor to her it might be favor but from what iv heard mayb it becaus of the tabloid represent of of the wai the book is go to come across i know that that not true so i dont see ani reason in you know it not true yeah i mean it iv known fai a lot longer than iv known nicol and and and it it pain to sai but it true to sai i mean fai is a person that had basic a timeshar unit at sever rehab facil i mean and for her to come on and do thi for monetari reason i cant imagin what other reason she would have for sai the thing that she said and i know do you like fai she been on of my closest friend up until recent and the fact that i havent heard from her and other close friend havent heard from her mean that she is go about thi without our without our approv you and keith ar friend yeah veri now keith your come forward becaus you want to set the record straight mostli about nicol right absolut there is there is on

how theyr go to resolv these problem in effect you outlin the potenti for more violenc if inde it occur unless peopl sit down and talk someth extraordinari happen in south africa just over the past forti eight hour the foreign minist of south africa mr <unk> ask for the unit nation to send in an envoi not onli to work on put down violenc but to work on get the impass broken so that <unk> and de klerk could sit down and talk about the constitut and major rule how do you evalu that develop well i think thi is a veri import develop but it also show that if the a n c hold out on the return to negoti it will for a chang be in the same posit that the south african govern us to be in name it will be isol internation there the unit nation the european commun certainli the organ of african uniti ar veri eager for these negoti to resum and i think not onli internation but even insid south africa there ar an aw lot peopl in the township who ar sick and tire of be <unk> everi dai by young thug who suppos as freedom fighter as comrad in the struggl and i think thei would like the a n c and the govern to get on with the busi of work out an interim govern and a new constitut base on what you know about the countri how long will that take well it awfulli hard to sai i mean im not ask you to have a crystal ball but base on your inform judgment how long will that take well i think it could be done with goodwil within a year i think on could get to <unk> elect within a rel short time given goodwil and that a big if and perhap now that i think peopl have <unk> into that abyss and you know we ar realli at a crossroad where the countri ha to decid whether it go to go take the low road of confront and declin disastr econom declin which ha been drive investor awai even after the lift of sanction or to take the <unk> which is that of negoti and accommod we ar pleas to welcom to the discuss on south africa kingslei <unk> the deputi repres of the african nation congresss mission to the unit nation mr <unk> welcom i dont know if youv been abl to hear much of the discuss i understand you were just come into the build but i would like to ask you what ar your thought about the prospect of nelson <unk> sit down with f w de klerk now to try to put a lid on violenc and get back to the talk about major rule well we have alwai been will to sit down and talk to the govern but we concern that we have been address to the govern the question of violenc that we have alwai request the govern to address thi becaus we hope address thi violenc will help in <unk> the confid in the negoti so the govern willing to move on thi with definit of speed up the process to go back to the negoti there no wai of go back to negoti and yet peopl have been kill and the govern is just hold it own hand not take no step to curtail thi violenc so i infer from that that the a n cs next move will hing greatli on the result of the discuss between the leader of your group nelson <unk> and presid de klerk well we do agre to thi type of a meet to address thi question of violenc there is a meet that ha been suggest is basic to address the violenc situat howev we ar sai that befor we back to the negoti the govern need to attend to thing that were previous agre with with the govern thing that have been identifi by the <unk> commiss as the caus of thi violenc and we ar sai that go back to negoti to discuss the veri same issu that theyv been discuss with the govern is not go to serv ani purpos the issu you ar refer ar your call your group call for the ban of so call cultur weapon and the build of fenc and the curb of polic abus ar those the issu you refer to definit those ar among the issu that you we ar refer to can the world expect to see other exampl of violenc and death as were seen in ciskei and the other homeland well it depend that depend basic on the abil of the south african govern to address thi issu serious prior to the massacr in ciskei the govern made an appeal to the a n c to postpon the march becaus of the fear of violenc as thei said but to our surpris thei didnt address thi fear of violenc instead de klerk author minist of polic mr <unk> to go to ciskei and discuss the secur of strateg instal amongst with hi but thei never attend their fear of the demonstr turn into violenc howev we ar sai that peac demonstr is the path of our legitim travel and therefor the right for the peopl to peacefulli demonstr should be guarante and protect by the state by the author well let me sai just on word that the violenc probabl would not have happen had the a n c adher to the arrang that wa made or work out by the court with the attend of a n c lawyer and if it had taken the advic of the independ peac <unk> not to extend the march beyond the stadium where it wa allow to take place but to try to break into the central busi district no no let address the violenc let not address the technic involv well even the a n c is now begin to think that that wa a major mistak no no technic have been involv in ani demonstr even here in the unit state where youv got demonstr you do have demonstr move beyond the polic barrier but we have never seen thi unpreced massacr but thi wa a deliber effort by ronni <unk> on of your nation execut member to lead the troop you know through a hole in the fenc into the central busi district and you boast about it no no let put so thi wa not a spontan thing thi wa a plan thing okai what im try to sai is that let us not address that as justif for thi violenc it unjustifi okai gentlemen let me <unk> myself becaus weve gone beyond the two segment time <unk> we had for thi program i just want to ask you mr <unk> on veri basic question when will nelson <unk> and f w de klerk sit down at thi emerg meet well the a n c have agre that mr <unk> lama the secretari gener and the minist of constitut develop for the govern should sit down to iron out certain issu prior to thi meet take place and to prepar the agenda if the

414,926,american polici toward bosnia chang thi week toward the posit of our nato alli and awai from advoc nato air power to bring the bosnian serb to the peac tabl thi leav the serb pretti much free to do as thei will and with nato diplomat rewrit peac propos that give the serb concess and the unit nation threaten to remov it peac keeper it appear that the sovereign state of bosnia hercegovina is about to be dismantl the busi of cast blame ha alreadi begun within nato though some within the allianc have alwai claim nato had no reason to try to stop the war in bosnia there no question whether the allianc ha enough cohes or credibl to face futur threat our own daniel schorr discuss thi appar bosnian end game and it implic for u s nato polici with republican senat john mccain of arizona and democrat congressman lee hamilton of indiana let me ask you senat mccain first here we ar after the ball wa over that is after the great g a t t victori next morn face onc again with life on the outsid world there is bosnia still there is u n there is nato and there is nato and russia and a host of other problem senat mccain bosnia first do you approv of the wai the clinton administr seem to be back awai from the us of forc and try to get back in step with european partner on bosnia well i think that the battlefield situat ha dictat that the option ar extrem limit and it is import at thi particular point that we join with the european alli as close as possibl to salvag what ha obvious been a terribl tragedi and a continu tragedi on of the lesson i believ that weve got to understand is that we cant have thi relationship between the unit nation which is an organ dedic to peac and nato which is at best an organ which is dedic to defens or war and have the unit nation give order to nato as to the implement of militari oper it doesnt work and frankli it is certainli on of the great tactic failur of thi overal veri tragic scenario lee hamilton i veri much agre with senat mccain i think the realiti in bosnia todai ar veri stark the polici option veri limit i certainli do not want to put u s combat forc into bosnia whatev the solut mai be theyr go to have to be work out in the context of our alli and our friend i dont think as senat mccain said that the u n nato dual kei arrang ha work well at all but that is the structur we ar we have proceed under for some month even year now and i think we simpli have to make the best of a good thing we have to continu to pursu a negoti settlement we have to try to bring the kill to an end i think unprofor must remain in bosnia and see if we can bring thi war to a conclus let me explain for those who dont know unprofor is the unit nation peacekeep forc in the former yugoslavia go ahead senat we should and must realiz that there is no doubt that it is in our vital nation secur interest that thi conflict not spread in the region two world war have been spawn in the balkan if thi war spill over into macedonia it could trigger a war between greec and turkei other nation such as hungari and bulgaria could be involv and i believ that on of the step that must be taken immedi is for the presid of the unit state to make it clear that we and our nato alli cannot afford that and we will take whatev step necessari in order to prevent the spread of thi war i do think it quit import now for the presid to end the polici of ambigu in the unit state it is time now for a presidenti speech about what is at stake for the unit state in bosnia what resourc were prepar to deploi what resourc were not prepar to deploi what we realli want to do here how we ar go to protect the nation interest of the unit state on of those nation interest most assuredli is what senat mccain ha mention and that to contain the conflict i think there is a great deal of confus in the congress and in the countri about american polici in bosnia and i think it time now to clear that up and the onli wai i know to clear it up is with a presidenti speech and do you think senat mccain that will do it a presidenti speech and well all understand i agre with congressman hamilton in that that a veri import step in time of crise on foreign polici issu the american peopl look to the presid of the unit state and it obviou that he not onli need to state what our polici is but also start take some concret step on the issu of the expans of nato and now the fact that russia seem to be react even the talk about on year for send up criteria do you think that weve push too fast for expans of nato to the former warsaw pact power and now were go to get in troubl with russia now frankli i think weve gone too slow i think that on of our goal ha alwai been to push a possibl conflict with russian imperi awai from the plane of europ i believ that we should have some time ago set up a set of specif criteria nation that would meet that criteria fairli easili would be poland czechoslovakia and hungari and i dont believ that the russian should view that as a threat in fact i think the opposit and it would give these countri a sens of comfort but more importantli it would help them in the respect that thei would be abl to spend much less of their hard earn fund on their own defens my own view is that we have to have a debat on whether or not to extend the secur guarante of nato in thi countri after all thi is the most seriou commit that a nation make that we will go to the defens of anoth nation that what nato is all about collect secur now we have to think veri carefulli about whether we should extend those secur guarante to the countri of eastern europ mayb beyond ukrain the baltic even russia it seem to me a prior question to the question of enlarg is the question of realli what is nato role secur role in the post cold war period and we need to get that veri clearli in mind as we move to the question of enlarg of nato im afraid were out of time thank you congressman hamilton and thank you senat mccain i almost got you into a disagr but im afraid that the thi atmospher of bipartisan harmoni in these last dai of the on hundr third congress prevail let see if it wash off into the next thi is daniel schorr,

422,943,thirti thousand american veteran of the persian gulf war sai thei suffer from what is known as gulf war syndrom headach bodi ach fatigu and rash ar among the symptom of thi mysteri ill now the chairman of the senat veteran affair committe jai rockefel sai experiment drug given to u s troop mai be the caus of the condit the pentagon administ the vaccin to protect the american forc from possibl chemic or biolog weapon a staff report by <unk> committe sai the drug probabl wouldnt have work if iraq had us those type of weapon the pentagon did not get permiss from mani of those who took the drug becaus of a wartim waiver grant by the food and drug administr c n n spoke on the phone with senat rockefel about thi matter earlier todai the pentagon in my judgment ha knowingli expos militari personnel to potenti danger substanc and theyv done it often in secret and in the persian gulf war thei didnt tell our soldier about it thei didnt give them inform we have ten of thousand of peopl now who fought for their countri now have thi persian gulf war syndrom which is a wretch thing to have and the pentagon claim no respons or no knowledg and it just it wrong join us now with the pentagon side to all thi is doctor sue bailei she is a deputi assist defens secretari and a psychiatrist doctor bailei thank you for be with us your welcom did the pentagon knowingli expos militari personnel to thi potenti danger substanc number what we did wa knowingli provid protect for the nerv ga that we felt thei could have been expos to so that thei were protect from that on of the drug that wa given wa a vaccin against <unk> that wa in the experiment stage and had not been approv by the f d a why wa that done well the f d a doe <unk> approv for mani of the vaccin and drug that ar necessari in wartim and it wa under that particular approv but why did the pentagon feel it wa safe to go and to have the troop take a drug that had not even been approv by the chief agenc in the unit state that is charg with approv these thing these drug well again let clarifi that it wa approv by the f d a for the specif wartim us and we must also realiz had thei been expos to <unk> as a chemic element of warfar that the risk would have been far greater than whatev side effect mai have been encount from the immun how do you know that senat rockefel said todai that it is hi belief that even if chemic and biolog warfar had been us that these drug would not have protect the soldier it depend on which drug your discuss <unk> for instanc first of all had no altern drug to be us to protect against nerv ga so as there wa no altern and as it wa approv as safe and effect all of our scientif knowledg tell us that it can provid that kind of protect for our troop in the event of biochem warfar that wa the wai in which it wa decid that it would be us i understand what your sai that the is your ear piec work doctor bailei can you hear me ye i can can you repeat that ye i wa just start to ask a question if the f d a had to grant a waiver for these drug to be administ to the troop that meant that thei had not been approv for wider us so in other word there were special circumst here did not that give you paus at the pentagon well again realiz that our concern wa that iraq would have us biochem warfar thei had done so in the past so the concern wa abov all to protect the health and welfar of the troop <unk> wa known to be effect in that protect mode the waiver that wa grant wa grant by the f d a so that in that militari combat situat that those troop could be given those seven hundr thousand troop who could have been expos to the nerv ga could be given the protect against it were the troop notifi that these drug were experiment thei might be danger well in fact i have with us a stai healthi in southwest asia booklet that all of the troop take with them now on deploy clearli it is someth that we ar try to do to provid for the troop inform about the drug and vaccin that thei receiv about ani side effect but im ask were thei notifi befor that thei were given the drug ye thei were notifi in brief and in booklet prior to their deploy well how do you explain senat rockefel and other sai that the pentagon ha shown a reckless disregard for the health of the soldier expos to danger substanc without their knowledg or consent well i think the concern here is that those ar unfair accus on the part of senat rockefel to call it reckless disregard in fact we have the highest regard for the safeti and welfar of our troop and again it would be my concern that if we did not provid the kind of antidot or prevent therapi that we can that we would then be disregard their health and welfar as we send them into an area where intellig tell us there could be nerv ga wa thi inform that your tell me provid to the research that went into the senat committe report clearli weve tri to provid all the inform avail about the scientif inform that tell us about the safeti and efficaci of not onli thi drug but all the immun and vaccin and drug that ar us to protect our troop in the event of warfar but the committe clearli ha gone the other wai in thi report and indict what the pentagon did well you would have to discuss with the committe what their conclus were it is my understand that we have provid them with all the inform that im tell you here todai and i would hope that again we would be abl to have the kind of discours with the congress that would let them understand our main concern which is again that we provid the most protect we possibl can in the event of <unk> warfar whether or not the troop were notifi whether or not these drug were safe is it your belief now that these drug mai have been the caus of thi gulf war syndrom that so mani veteran of the gulf war ar now experienc well i should sai first of all that nineti eight percent of seven hundr thousand troop that were deploi came back not report ani symptom of those that have we ar continu research and treatment for those i should also let you know that the major of those peopl appear to have <unk> <unk> ill for the smaller number that remain unexplain it is undetermin at thi point what the <unk> factor might be is it conceiv that it could have been these drug i suppos it conceiv but we have other theori and investig on go which ar probabl more accur or ar hypothet more probabl all right well doctor sue bailei deputi assist defens secretari we appreci your be with us,

426,953,hello and welcom to diplomat licens richard roth is off im gari tuchman there ar roughli twenti three thousand peacekeep in bosnia <unk> but should thei be call peacekeep or peac seeker after all there is current no peac to keep in bosnia and now prepar ar be made in case a troop evacu is necessari theyv come under militari bombard and at the same time heavi critic liter and figur the u n peacekeep in bosnia <unk> have been under fire veri often peacekeep involv get into a situat where your face with two or three or four bad choic and peacekeep seem to repres the least bad choic that is not an ideal world and that mai be an understat unprofor forc ar best suit to maintain a peac that alreadi exist but there is no such peac in bosnia the deadli violenc continu unab and peacekeep troop have no mandat to fight back there noth wrong with peacekeep per se but it a littl like a medicin you know it a good cold remedi but unfortun it wa appli in thi case to a cancer and it simpli couldnt do the job but why ha the situat gotten so bad some sai if the u n hadnt implement an arm embargo against the bosnian troop peacekeep could fulfil their mission shortli after the end of the cold war slovenia declar it independ and the serb attack slovenia but slovenia to the surpris of the attack serb had weapon to defend themselv the <unk> turn those weapon on the serb and the serb <unk> mani critic sai in the futur the u n secur council which make the decis when it come to peacekeep action must avoid do what it done in bosnia you have a case where the russian basic ar lean on direct the british and french and american ar somewher in between or lean the other wai and there isnt a true consensu and in that case you dont have a unit nation if in fact the nation arent unit but thei ar unit enough to state that an evacu of bosnia is by no mean inevit well the secur council is not consid that issu current there is no proposit on the tabl for that the peacekeep sai all thei can do is focu on what thei can accomplish with the resourc thei have i am confid that there ar peopl aliv todai in bosnia fed and shelter and hous todai in bosnia who wouldnt be aliv if unprofor had not been deploi but how mani more would be aliv if unprofor arriv earlier in the crisi or had a clearer mission it a question that troubl mani so what go on behind the scene at the unit nation with us to offer some insight is on of our regular here on diplomat licens afsan bassir pour the u n correspond for le mond afsan what the latest at the secur council well actual gari the answer to that question is simpli noth noth is go on about bosnia in the secur council the last major event here wa the russian veto that wa last fridai when russia veto the resolut about bosnia that would have reinforc the embargo between bosnia and serbia now amid much talk in the press about the pull out of unprofor from bosnia the major contributor troop contributor the french and the british assur us that thei have no intent of pull out their troop and it wa interest that even the bosnian govern said openli that thei dont want unprofor to pull out afsan thank for the insight well have you back a littl bit later in the show thank you well an actress who ha receiv much attent as a <unk> long time support of the palestin liber organ spoke out at the unit nation headquart on fridai vanessa redgrav wa at the u n to talk about her support for the govern of bosnia and specif the citizen of sarajevo more shell have fallen on sarajevo than fell on the whole of yugoslavia when the nazi were shell invad and occupi yugoslavia more shell in those nine hundr fifti dai than fell on the whole of yugoslavia and as im sure your all awar hitler turn the whole might of the nazi third reich befor thei attack russia on yugoslavia more shell have fallen in those nine hundr fifti dai and now thei ar fall thick and fast again welcom back in the nearli fifti year of u n histori there have been thirti four peacekeep or monitor mission fulli half of them ar still in oper but late were hear a lot about troop withdraw and possibl troop withdraw with us on diplomat licens is the militari advis for those peacekeep oper major gener mauric <unk> and to join us in the question jame bone the u n correspond for the time of london gener <unk> thank for join us your quit welcom militarili how ar thing go right now in bosnia probabl you know as much as i do as what is go out now in the mission in bosnia it extrem danger extrem complex there is a lot of diplomat mission go on there a lot of militari action go on it unsaf for our troop the mandat is extrem difficult and i dont want to go into detail and there ha been talk of withdraw in the past few dai includ an announc by the u s and that lead up to the next question gener if there is a withdraw how danger would that process be well in a withdraw you have to plan for the worst case and hope for the best and in that <unk> bosnia <unk> the worst case is pretti bad and that the reason why we cannot even contempl of withdraw under the worst scenario on our own and we would need some outsid help well how much outsid help would you need gener iv seen figur bandi around some as high as on hundr twenti five thousand troop if it were done in the midst of winter well it will depend on the condit and i dont want to specul now or give you some plan figur thei have not been releas by nato or unprofor and im not the on who is go to releas some of our estim but it a fairli high estim it a difficult terrain to go in and you need not onli combat troop but if you ar go to pull those out you need a complet militar logist system a lot of air cover a lot of transport a lot of engin and these resourc dont exist now in the mission and would that includ pull the troop out of croatia as well well let see what the decis of the council is and then i can answer that question well doe the plan cover that point though the plan is work now for the worst case scenario and the worst case scenario of cours start with bosnia <unk> and there is no indic now that the what we call croatia command now would need the same treatment or the same decis would be taken gener doe thi possibl withdraw in bosnia how doe it compar to the withdraw in somalia were not talk the same procedur at all were not talk on the same track and we ar not talk about the same spread of our troop on the ground right now in somalia in <unk> the troop ar be pull out of <unk> right now we have warship that ar off the coast of <unk> and commerci ship ar load now the troop and the equip and i think by eleven at night or twelfth of decemb <unk> will have been vacat and all the rest of our troop will be in mogadishu and the withdraw of mogadishu ha been go on sinc we were ask by the council to reduc first to fifteen thousand and then close the mission down so we call it an administr withdraw gener just to clarifi in somalia ar you go to need american ground forc under american command to come into somalia to evacu the troop or ar you go to be abl to get the u n troop out without that let me qualifi that in the worst case scenario we need a naval task forc off the coast that will give us air cover will give us capabl to withdraw equip and men from the beach becaus it could happen that the port and the airport ar complet <unk> becaus of fire come in or destruct and also to withdraw the last protect team that we will have insid mogadishu we will need some special troop like marin to come in and realli close the mission for us in a veri orderli and safe wai so far itali ha offer marin and we have not receiv a confirm from the u s that thei will provid a forc yet itali offer four hundr how mani more do you need our estim is that we need some more than four thousand four hundr how mani more oh let call it now up to two thousand gener you allud to the mandat befor and then said you didnt want to sai veri much about it im not go to probe too deepli becaus i realiz you dont make the polici howev ar you a littl frustrat that your peacekeep forc in bosnia cannot realli do veri much to fight back well your talk to a peacekeep in here and were not in a competit in bosnia <unk> to see who is go to fight back we didnt go there to fight back we went there to fulfil the mandat and if you cannot fulfil the mandat and if you would fight back you would still not fulfil the mandat and take a lot of casualti youd have mayb some happier soldier but youd have a lot of dead soldier too gener there been a lot of talk recent about the reinforc of the bosnian <unk> air defens with i think sam six missil that seem to have come in from the rump state of yugoslavia from belgrad thi seem to have effect stop the nato low fly zone enforc oper is that go to be possibl to resum that oper at ani time thei certainli make the air oper extrem danger for those who execut it and also if you get into air oper like we were do befor in a place where there is no ground defens you dont have to have such wide rang air oper but now if were face seriou and veri capabl ground defens the air oper come in either from the no fly zone close air support or air strike have to come in with all the capabl to defend themself and carri on their mission which mean attack ground target that threaten the airplan gener mauric <unk> we want to thank

<unk> our understand that not onli can we get it through congress which we expect to do but that when it get to the presid desk it will be sign so were veri pleas and veri excit to have an opportun to work with the presid on thi effort well there still the veri minor detail of how big a tax cut were talk about and how it get paid for the administr were told is look at someth in the neighborhood of thirti billion dollar although that a tent number and we ar told at least from what we read that you and some of your colleagu ar look at someth much bigger than that how much a differ ar we talk about here well i think were talk about a big differ depend on whether i assum the presid project ar over five year as our ar we talk about and expect to have a middl incom tax cut especi for famili with a five hundr dollar per child credit we also believ that we need to give further tax relief to famili that take care of their elderli senior we need to give some tax relief to the senior in term of the tax on their social secur benefit then also we need to coupl that with some tax cut that will encourag further econom growth and job creation so we intend to give the presid a packag of tax reduct that ar larger than that and we intend to pai for them with the the payment will be made were go to give the presid an opportun to look at a much more comprehens packag but certainli a piec of the packag will be the middl incom tax cut that he talk about how much monei ar we ar you talk about in term of tax cut overal oh i think the overal tax reduct will be someth around in the neighborhood of on hundr seventi seven billion dollar over five year we of cours will pai for that in part with our welfar reform packag which the presid also <unk> and then of cours further reduct in spend which of cours the american peopl have said thei want to see us cut spend first we intend to do that as well and what ar the big chunk of that those spend cut go to be well we have the budget committe work on that we will have propos for them but there will be a packag of spend reduct that will be put forward frankli befor the tax cut and can you just give us some idea of what i mean ar we look at entitl cut ar we look at social secur medicar for upper incom peopl well my own view of the matter is that what we need to do is make sure we have thoroughli well agre the packag befor we start specul about what might be in it washington d c right is now is rife with rumor as you know and there no need to add to that until we have had a chanc to see our committe work thoroughli through the packag how would your middl the middl incom tax cut that you forese how would that work exactli it would be a credit of five hundr dollar for a famili in what incom rang well i think there a cap at a higher incom bracket but for averag and middl incom famili you would have a tax credit of five hundr dollar per child and what is averag or middl incom well you know that a much debat item here but id sai anywher in the thirti thousand dollar to fifti thousand dollar bracket clearli your talk about the averag middl incom american thirti to forti thousand but certainli famili with incom lower than that would benefit from the same packag now how strongli do republican feel about the five hundr dollar a famili becaus the administr again is talk about someth smaller than that five hundr dollar per child well let me put it thi wai judi i have rais five children had i had such an opportun in my tax reduct at the birth of each those five children i would have been abl to accumul a nice colleg fund for each of the five children by just put their tax credit into a colleg fund certainli by the time thei got colleg ag thei would have had a great stake for their colleg educ otherwis mayb that could have gone for the brace iv struggl through all of that busi at on point in their life thei need the brace at anoth time it mai be mayb even a graduat gown or someth special like that i can tell you famili can find plenti of good wai to us that tax credit for their children so congressman armei what is thi fight go to come down to is it go to come down to what can be cut what can republican and the administr democrat agre should be cut to pai for what size tax cut well sure i mean it much easier alwai to agre upon the principl you alwai have to work out with some greater degre of rigor the detail of the matter but the fact is we will present the presid a middl incom tax break within on hundr dai were veri confid that it will be paid for we know itll be paid for and it will certainli be an option for the presid to sign and make good on thi promis for a middl incom tax cut onc again on the whole entitl question though isnt thi someth that ha to be address if big monei is go to be found and taken out of the feder spend pictur there no doubt about it and there plenti of room for smart reduct in entitl spend on of the thing we have to alwai remind ourselv is that onli on out of everi seven entitl dollar goe to somebodi at or below the poverti level of incom that tell me and that tell america there plenti of room for smart cut and smart revis in entitl spend we need to studi these thing through make sure that those peopl who ar truli needi do not have their benefit reduc and make smart reduct that what we think were do with welfar reform and well have an opportun to look at other form of entitl spend as well well congressman richard armei anytim your readi to give us more specif were readi and will to talk to you about them incom hous major leader richard armei

444,987,as weve been report in a littl over three hour presid clinton present congress to hi propos nineteen nineti six feder budget but thi is a much differ congress mr clinton is deal with sinc last <unk> elect join us to discuss the budget and other issu republican nation committe chairman halei barbour and democrat parti strategist paul begala good morn to you both good morn bob morn mr begala let me turn to you first and ask you why know the republican were go after the budget with a meat ax did the presid go after it with a scalpel well i dont agre with that character bob thi presid ha alreadi cut the budget by five hundr dollar billion without a singl republican vote thi budget continu that work cut the budget again by on hundr forti four dollar billion the presid budget todai cut the deficit cut spend and cut tax for the middl class but what it doesnt do is just as import it doe not cut medicar in order to cut capit gain tax on the veri rich that someth that mr <unk> parti and the republican want to do as soon as thei get their hand on thi budget theyr go to go right after medicar and thi presid cut the deficit without cut into medicar so that so that the republican wont be abl to give their capit gain tax cut to the veri rich ar you peopl go to do that mr barbour of cours the fact of the matter is bob in thi budget the deficit go to go up and it go to continu to be about two hundr dollar billion for the next ten or twelv year and the american peopl know that that not accept but i want just start off by sai we do not dismiss the presid budget out of hand it not dead on arriv as thei us to sai about georg bush budget or ronald reagan budget when it went befor the democrat congress were go to give it the seriou consider that it deserv the fact of the matter is though everybodi understand that it doesnt do enough well were determin to have a balanc budget by the year two thousand two presid clinton budget doe not do that when it come to spend in fact presid clinton not onli didnt bite the bullet he didnt even bite the b b how about the minimum wage issu mr barbour the presid ha toss that ball in your court now well presid clinton want to rais the minimum wage to five dollar and fifteen cent an hour were not go to do anyth that destroi job or is anti young or anti poor and the fact of the matter is the last time that we rais the minimum wage it did hurt job particularli among african american peopl whose wage went whose job loss went up unemploy rate went up thirti percent the congression budget offic when it wa control by the democrat said a minimum wage increas of thi magnitud would cost five hundr thousand job and for what purpos seventi percent of the peopl who earn the minimum wage ar part time worker a million of them ar teenag who come from famili that have famili incom of fifti thousand dollar a year onli eight percent of of head of household earn a minimum wage and mani of them ar not poor so there is no case for thi minimum wage increas but when you see the job loss and how anti small busi it is the case against it is overwhelm mr begala do you expect ani increas in the minimum wage to actual surviv congress well i think the american peopl ar go to want on the republican ar go to have to answer whether or not thei deliv on you cant rais a famili on the eight thousand dollar or nine thousand dollar a year that the minimum wage provid it i i cant help but laugh though bob to hear halei barbour the chairman of the republican nation committe all of a sudden now with new found word about teenag and poor peopl and minor thi is a parti the republican that ar go to try to go after student loan that help young peopl try to go after medicar that help elderli peopl try to go after peopl that can rais peopl up out of poverti and into the middl class and help to rais peopl in the middl class up into prosper that the target that thei have set in their budget it why thei oppos a minimum wage which is just fundament fair for work peopl and yet thei want to do everyth thei can to cut medicar in order to give a tax break to the veri rich let talk about let me just mention bob all right briefli bill clinton budget cut medicar fifti six dollar billion two year ago in the clinton tax bill medicar wa cut fifti six dollar billion all thi idea that the republican ar go to cut medicar you know let get the fact straight about who alreadi cut medicar without as paul said without on singl republican vote for it let me get thi straight first the medicar cut in the presid budget were fifti six dollar billion of cut on provid that is the physician and hospit that provid it and that is enough cut alreadi if you go beyond that you start to cut senior citizen i want to ask the chairman here if hell give a pledg that the republican will not cut medicar ani farther well the fact of the matter is presid clinton who who himself appoint an entitl commiss two year ago becaus of the problem the fact that medicar is go into bankruptci and he appoint a commiss which made recommend to him but he just ignor him he wont stand up and even sai on thing about the problem hi own commiss said had to be tend to he and so but who go to be <unk> here and who just go to take the polit easi wai out o k well id like to run down that trail further but becaus of time constraint let turn to a coupl of issu doctor henri foster the presid choic to be surgeon gener mr barbour two kei republican both dole and lott sai it is in troubl is he go to get through congress well i think a lot of it depend on hi testimoni and i dont want to prejudg him but he ha been a on the board of a group that advoc give condom to all peopl all children in school to teach <unk> to peopl in kindergarten now i dont know if he share those view or not but certainli that rais red flag the question of abort i mean doe is he for abort on demand at ani time and pregnanc for ani reason or no reason or doe he favor some limit those ar question that have to come out of these hear paul begala the republican ar appar consid pull back back off at least some affirm action program ar you awar of that well let the republican state their posit for themselv bob i want to jump in to defend the record of doctor foster he ha for exampl been endors by bill <unk> who is a new republican senat veri conserv he the senat from tennesse he ha been a physician by train and he ha work with doctor foster and he endors him lamar alexand who veri much would like to be presid but wa the governor of <unk> which is where doctor foster from he ha endors thi man the group that he been on the board of is call plan parenthood and it wa found mani year ago by the father of georg bush so i dont think exactli thi is a radic nomin it just the republican again try to divid peopl and doctor foster a man who built hi career on deliv babi but also try to prevent teenag pregnanc and he had remark success with that in tennesse as even the most conserv republican in hi state will tell you all right mr barbour befor you folk get awai i have to ask you about senat strom thurmond report circul now that the chairman of the senat arm servic committe who

focu of the prosecut effort thi week it wa thei sai an abus and violent relationship that culmin in murder last fridai an emot denis brown told the juror of on incid that prosecutor believ show just how violent o j simpson could be toward hi wife yell me i dont take her for grant i do everyth for her i give her everyth and he continu and then a whole fight broke out and pictur start fly off the wall cloth start fly i ran upstair got cloth start fly down the stair and grab nicol told her to get out of hi hous want us all out of hi hous pick her up through her against a wall pick her up through her out of the hous she end up on her she end up fall she end up on her <unk> and on her butt and so with that the juror were sent back into sequestr for the weekend with nicol brown simpson recal not just in the substanc of her sister testimoni but in the veri bone of her face in that strike brown famili resembl so it is then a tough choic for o j simpson legal team court t vs kristin jeannett myer who cover the defens for us join us now from lo angel with more kristin whatll it be for the defens here the hard road or go easi on thi wit i think we can count on see a kinder <unk> defens team in thi cross examin it go to be done by robert shapiro and i spoke with him over the weekend he is clear that the last thing he want is to caus denis brown to cry on the stand becaus he realiz the emot impact of a famili member of the victim and it just would not serv the defens to in ani wai appear to be increas her pain and kristin i wonder at thi junctur of the trial ha anyth to do with it after the first week the defens take a veri aggress standpoint each and everi time it seem get it back in spade as it were ar thei rethink just how hard thei want to go at thi trial it it hard to character it as rethink becaus you have a lot of differ person and attornei on thi defens team and so while carl dougla wa veri aggress with ron shipp it ha been decid for month that robert shapiro wa go to do the cross examin of denis brown and i dont think he ever entertain the notion of be aggress with her so not withstand what happen last week with carl dougla thi is the plan that robert shapiro sai he alwai had sinc he realiz that he would be the person to do the cross examin of denis brown a tough job certainli kristin jeannett myer thank for that report now what denis brown doe for the prosecut in thi trial is take juror into the heart of the relationship that the state contend is the kei to understand these crime and it isnt a pretti pictur that denis brown paint of that relationship o j simpson she ha testifi wa a mean and an arrog husband for instanc it mai be that among the most shock alleg of abus against o j simpson is denis brown testimoni from fridai of a nineteen eighti nine incid where the defend publicli and grossli humili hi wife well we all start well we were all drink and <unk> around and be loud and danc and have a great time and then at on point o j grab nicol crotch and said thi is where babi come from and thi belong to me and nicol just sort of wrote it off like it wa noth you know like she wa us to that kind of treatment and if i i thought it wa realli humili if you ask me well the behavior denis brown describ there is vile by ani standard but nicol brown simpson respons her sister testifi indic she wa us to such treatment when he grab her in the crotch were there peopl around oh yeah the bar wa pack stranger yeah yeah he wa talk to the stranger did your sister nicol react to thi at all she just kind of wrote it off and just you know shrug her shoulder you know stop it or whatev i mean it wa i dont know she didnt realli react what kind of man would sai such a thing do such a thing in public that what prosecutor want the juror to ponder here and denis brown testimoni about the defend reaction fit into the state theori that o j simpson felt he control nicol brown simpson to the point of ownership did the defend appear mad or angri or upset when he grab your sister crotch and made these statement in front of these stranger number number he wasnt angri it wa hi that the wai he he just the wai he act the wai it wa like thi belong to me thi is mine he wasnt angri when he said it he just made it a point he want it to be known that that wa hi well court t vs fred graham and gregg jarrett ar stand by in lo angel and fred let me ask you how tough a wit is denis brown for the defens well i certainli think the prosecut thought that her perform on fridai must have been veri effect becaus prosecutor chri darden milk it for everyth it wa worth by call for a pre matur recess or <unk> of the trial on fridai so that the juror could medit about her tear over the weekend but i must sai terri that you know you can have too much of a good thing and gregg jarrett ha look into <unk> here and i think that he probabl had a heart to heart talk with her over the weekend yeah i think your right he he realli ha to do that to control her demeanor to try to get her to knock off the gratuit comment that ar realli opinion you know the law in california doe not requir a lawyer to control hi witnesss demeanor and gratuit comment it govern by the rule of court and there noth in there in the rule of court and as a practic matter you realli do want to control your wit becaus the more opinion that she state in the case the more bia she reveal and the less like it is that the juri might believ her thei might discredit her let me ask you becaus johnni cochran on of the defens lawyer said on the wai out of the courthous he thought some of it the weep wa deliber that there a danger isnt it well there is a danger it a danger for cochran to make statement like that but of cours these juror ar sequest but i mean with your i mean with the juri that she might if thei think that there a problem yeah there is a real problem with that and you know the judg ha got to sort of keep an ey on the situat too he ha an oblig to control the wit he can either admonish the wit to stop the gratuit comment or he can instruct the juror to strike it from their mind disregard it or both and you know at wors case scenario a judg can alwai begin contempt proceed against a wit that simpli is unrespons to all of the question that unlik there though you know it it what happen if she just wont shape up or cant well if she wont shape up the judg can call a recess talk to her person in fact the judg can talk to her in front of the juror and that would be a littl riski and then of cours contempt is the ultim sanction my experi is the <unk> wit iv ever seen alwai manag to get a grip on themselv now when you turn back around to what the defens might do on thi cross examin how far do you think shapiro might go in ask her about there some vulner here without have problem himself and take chanc and creat sympathi with the juri yeah on of the thing that some peopl have suggest that shapiro might do is sai look denis brown you believ o j simpson guilti and that why your testifi against him in the wai that you ar you cant ask a wit about guilt or innoc that an ultim question of fact onli the juri mai decid that to do otherwis would allow a littl bit like an elect or a ballot initi everybodi take the wit and sai i vote for guilti i vote for not guilti so you cant you cant do that what shapiro could do is sai look you have form an opinion about whether or nor mr simpson commit thi crime havent you and without state that opinion isnt it true that that ha shade and color your testimoni but you know i dont think he need to do that becaus on fridai a clear signal wa sent from that wit stand to the juror about how denis brown feel toward o j simpson yeah and on of the thing that we saw is that if that there ar so mani wai to deal with thi if your the defens you can call for a side bar you can go up and talk with the judg and sort of break up the pace of thi and head her off from break down and you saw it right at the start of her testimoni on fridai rather routin question and the first thing you now on of the defens sai let go up and talk to the judg see how that work becaus you mai see a lot of it todai and you return to the defend home after the game correct ye ye anyth unusu happen then yeah o j got real upset and he start scream at nicol your honor and were us to side bar we mai get us more us to them befor the dai is over terri well fred listen to your discuss a question occur to me and that is with a volatil wit like thi for the prosecut what if she <unk> out someth that inadmiss and so prejudici that it give rise to a question about the fair of the trial what if she were to <unk> out nicol told me she wa frighten he wa go to kill her can a mistrial occur well terri you know i dont think anyon want a mistrial in thi case the defens would have to ask for on it had some opportun to do that and thei alwai sai hei we want we want a decis here but you know it it youd have a situat that we see so often in which the judg would admonish the juri to dismiss it from their mind and like the old sai goe it like tell a child not to think about a purpl cow try to <unk> the bell,

summer of nineteen forti then there is here on which wa built in the fall of nineteen forti and to the back is a third oven which isnt there anymor which wa built in the fall of nineteen forti on theyr cheap i mean you see theyr veri simpl structur if we would go to a civilian inciner we would have some kind of appropri decor which give a certain digniti to the piec as a last place where a corps is transform into ash the next stage in the transit of auschwitz from prison to death camp came in nineteen forti on <unk> head of the s s made hi first visit with a plan that would rapidli enlarg the number of inmat it ha to do with a larg program of what we call todai ethnic cleans in which the polish popul in thi area move out in a veri big scale and ethnic german from eastern poland ar brought here to <unk> the area thi book wa given to all the settler who move in the area just south of auschwitz and perhap on of the most tell illustr is thi on where we see the ethnic german move from wherev thei had live for centuri to a new and brighter futur in the area of auschwitz the area around auschwitz had larg deposit of coal and <unk> suppli of water and the giant chemic compani i g <unk> becam interest in locat a massiv factori there <unk> now see a few opportun in auschwitz which didnt exist befor first of all he see that he can in some wai suppli labor to the build up of the plant and and get monei for that get an incom for that now that why he come in march nineteen forti on to auschwitz visit the area with eager <unk> offici and then decid to establish in birkenau initi a camp for on hundr thousand prison the german invas of russia would provid prison of war the slave labor to build the i g <unk> factori the locat for the new camp to hous these prison wa to be three kilomet from auschwitz at a <unk> <unk> site call birkenau name after the birch wood that fring it the slave labor camp for on hundr thousand prison wa larger than anyth the s s had organ befor thi is the first plan which wa creat by a young architect fritz <unk> who wa work alreadi had been work for a year in the s s <unk> and he draft hi plan on the what is it it wa the fourteenth of octob actual had anoth on too and a plan here and on even on week earlier we can actual follow these design week by week almost as thei ar creat and as thei ar chang and now suddenli he ha to design someth for on hundr thousand peopl so he doe thi great field of on thousand on hundr meter by around seven hundr twenti meter and he go to put in thi larg field a number of barrack arrang barrack in what he think is a sensibl wai but the architect had to modifi the plan when <unk> order a further enlarg of the camp to take an extra twenti five thousand prison and so in accord with <unk> instruct of march first nineteen forti on suddenli thei decid to increas the capac of each <unk> and so he cross out the five hundr fifti put in seven hundr forti four and that the new offici capac of the camp so now the camp can hold on hundr twenti five thousand inmat instead of a littl under on hundr thousand inmat and thi is what such a draw translat into thi <unk> wa design to hold seven hundr fifti peopl after an initi calcul of around five hundr fifti peopl and the chang wa made by simpli increas the number of peopl who would live on a in a bai like thi on a like that from three peopl to four peopl and i calcul thi onc the space of thi <unk> liter peopl had fifti nine cubic feet per person inclus the corridor inclus all the other space which is more or less the space of a coffin not onli were the barrack horribl overcrowd thei contain no sanit facil at all thi section of the camp wa suppos to hous twelv thousand peopl and there were two of these barrack where in each sit four hundr peopl could <unk> simultan so that mean that you have in fact on <unk> for six thousand peopl now thi is alreadi horribl and you had to do it all in a hurri ten or fifteen minut in the morn wa all the time allow for thi then of cours there wa no wai to flush the sewer the russian prison di by the thousand of dysenteri and <unk> the s s realiz that a camp of on hundr twenti five thousand prison would need to dispos of a larg number of bodi as we know from a letter of <unk> of the fourteenth of octob that exactli the same dai that the second plan wa approv that <unk> would come to auschwitz in order to design for them in a kind of a dialogu with <unk> the chief architect a new <unk> for birkenau <unk> came to the meet in auschwitz with a bold concept five set of three oven inciner were to be construct in a row all link to on chimnei and hous in a grand new build and what is remark about thi is the size of thi <unk> fifteen corps can be burn at the same time mayb even more what we see here is a main <unk> room in which we see five oven perfectli label on through five each with three inciner and here in detail which is quit interest thi is a door outsid and there ar actual stair go into that basement and a <unk> it call a slide so you can sort of bring corps in and thei can you can slide them down into the basement you dont have to carri them the corps chute or <unk> wa design to give access to two larg underground <unk> with ventil system built into the wall these were kei element in the futur transform of the <unk> into ga chamber but on the plan at thi time there is no indic that thi build is for ani other purpos than <unk> of the bodi of the dead prison of birkenau thi grand <unk> wa an expens project and the <unk> did not want to build it in birkenau in what thei consid to be a temporari labor camp thei plan to build it in the auschwitz prison in octob nineteen forti on <unk> <unk> goer <unk> <unk> claim on russian prison of war and <unk> had to look elsewher for the slave labor that he need for the i g <unk> factori jew who were be round up and kill were the onli avail sourc <unk> decis to us the jew as slave labor at birkenau wa a fundament break with a polici that had start with the invas of the soviet union in nineteen forti on follow behind the german armi were the <unk> or special group team of s s men and polic whose job it wa to round up the

railwai line at the end of the railwai line and then we have a plan of august nineteen forti two where there ar two sit right there why did the plan for thi build chang so much in the first six month of nineteen forti two and why were two build plan not on the answer is that auschwitz birkenau wa now assum it final function as a death camp command <unk> <unk> had been told by <unk> in nineteen forti on that auschwitz wa go to be a center for kill the jew and that he want a method that wa more reliabl than carbon monoxid an experi wa conduct us a pesticid call <unk> b accord to the testimoni

<unk> the project discuss in thi meet ar now what li in ruin in birkenau by the end of august when <unk> have hi commiss tell <unk> complet the master plan of the camp which wa now to accommod mass murder and the structur of the camp wa realli veri simpl as it appear in these final master plan basic we have the field here with the barrack which follow veri much <unk> design of nineteen forti on it ha expand and then to the west side of the camp awai from the main line of traffic the railroad between between czechoslovakia and <unk> we have the four <unk> <unk> the second <unk> the third and both side of the railwai line spur into the camp which will be complet in nineteen forti four and then in the forest <unk> the fourth and <unk> v realli back up instal so the train would come from the main railwai line on thi spur and then thei would go through the gate and arriv in the station of auschwitz there a select would take place right at thi point where there were a number of choic peopl could be sent either toward <unk> the second and <unk> the third here at the end west end side of the station or thei could be sent through thi road toward the north side of the camp toward <unk> the fourth and <unk> v the report of the august nineteen forti two meet make clear that <unk> wa awar of what wa happen in birkenau it is also appar that the architect understood the purpos of the new build as well <unk> the second wa alreadi under construct and the blueprint reveal the chang thei made to the build to transform the underground <unk> into ga chamber now we have the next plan thi is date on the nineteenth of decemb nineteen forti two and here we find a veri remark develop it drawn by walter <unk> himself he an architect he not on of the inmat it obvious a kind of secret plot we see now that the slide ha disappear now why is there a new <unk> which is on the side of the railwai track the reason is veri clear that now for the first time we have a design which indic that those who will in some wai occupi the <unk> ar aliv when thei come in the transform of the <unk> into a ga chamber wa made easier by an origin featur of their design seen here in thi cross section draw a ventil system that wa to be built into the wall we ar sit here on the floor of what remain of the floor of the ga chamber of <unk> number the third and it quit interest becaus actual at thi point we see the remain of the ventil system which had been design from the veri begin for thi morgu and it wa thi ventil system which made it possibl to extract the ga veri veri quickli other modif includ ga tight door with <unk> and <unk> suppli the ga detector at the end of nineteen forti two work start on the three new <unk> in birkenau and the prison were organ into massiv work group well the differ wa enorm compar with all the other camp on my second dai there i saw prison call to work when the prison were group into four group each group had two peopl hold a larg banner with written sign <unk> i <unk> the second <unk> the third <unk> the fourth i kept stare at it and i couldnt understand what it wa all about then a slovak prison came who had been there for some time and explain to me that four <unk> were be built all at the same time i ask him why four well even for the two of us he said that made me realiz i had come to a place where i wa go to have my own funer construct took place dai and night nonstop but sometim there were stoppag where materi were not deliv due to lack of wagon or the sever winter not on of the <unk> wa finish on time the delai creat consider anxieti in berlin becaus the liquid of the ghetto wa proceed apac the transport were be load and the momentum of the final solut could not be stop the head of the build administr in berlin fritz <unk> write urgent to auschwitz he sai in hi letter of the eleventh of januari i know that you have some problem but you realli have to do everyth to get stuff finish and be pleas keep me dai by the week by week of what is happen and so we have a first report on the twenti third of januari nineteen forti three in which <unk> give to <unk> a report on the twenti ninth of januari a week later we have anoth report thi on which ha to do with the electr sign by a member of a e g the major german electr compani which is go to creat the instal it sai veri clearli you will be abl to kill and you will be abl to burn simultan in thi <unk> so we we look at thi and we see it not onli <unk> it not onli the builder which ar involv but it also on of the major german electr compani a e g which still todai ha a veri prosper exist in the feder republ final the <unk> were finish and hand over to the s s first <unk> the second wa complet and <unk> six hundr jew on march thirteenth then the fourth and v were complet and final <unk> the third a mirror imag of <unk> the second it wa hand over in june nineteen forti three birkenau wa fulli oper poison ga and <unk> technolog had been deliber combin to creat a mechan of mass murder final here anoth document that sai that in <unk> i that three hundr forti peopl can be inciner everi twenti four hour then in number the second and the third on thousand four hundr forti peopl each and then the fourth and v seven hundr sixti eight so there is a daili inciner capac in auschwitz at that moment of four thousand seven hundr fifti six person jew in the ghetto throughout europ would be round up and load with a hand of their belong onto transport train men women and children would be slowli carri without food water or sanit toward auschwitz these transport would arriv on a daili basi on the railwai line at birkenau here those left aliv would be unload i dont know what time it wa it wa light the train stop you hear <unk> run it must have been the s s the gestapo and thei told us ar open up and thei shout to us <unk> out out quick <unk> quick quick i saw a group of s s men stand here or walk about the railwai truck were there too and it took some time for peopl to get out of the truck and then peopl were group into two line on wa for men the other wa for women with children thei shout men and women to separ men on column women on the other column and we form like a five row so my sister and i and my three friend we stood like in <unk> first the men move on slowli befor the s s man who stood about here somewher thei came befor him on after the other and he wave hi glove on wai or the other those on that side went to that <unk> and the other stood wait have been detail for work those were mainli young peopl and were all walk and im take for grant that my mama is follow with my littl brother and as we approach in front to thi s s and gestapo and he stand like thi with hi finger like you thi wai im here like toward like im toward you and he stand there and he go like thi and us five girl just to thi gate and other peopl go to through thi gate and for a slight second i didnt turn around im take for grant my mama is follow me but as i turn around to see whether she come she alreadi gone so from that dai on that wa nineteen forti four veri earli septemb or so i havent seen my mother aliv and my littl brother that took at least an hour the whole procedur it wa perfectli well organ the main auschwitz camp probabl had receiv a telegram or some other messag that a transport wa come at such and such a time and thei had by then given the order to start the fire in the oven the <unk> luggag which thei were help with stai here pile up and thei went on without it thei were promis thei would get it all back and of cours thei didnt need anyth ani longer i had to get us to it slowli like everyon els ha to everyon got us to it and the worst wa when thei carri women on an open truck in shirt thei were take them to the <unk> and we saw it all you know those peopl who could not work the old the young and those with children were march to on of the four ga chamber in birkenau and <unk> to death all that remain now of thi mass slaughter ar blueprint and the twist wreckag of the build themselv thi is the ruin of <unk> the second of which we have seen the design in the archiv the peopl who were condemn to die here would immedi file into the <unk> which is behind here come out of that door there at the <unk> level file through a <unk> down here into the ga chamber thi is the place where corps were move and then to the side here we see three time five time three track for the <unk> which allow the <unk> to bring in the corps insid the oven and we can check again the evid as we find it on the site with the blueprint and we see here the littl railwai track plu the railwai track into the oven again all thi is <unk> label <unk> and so on if we now move to <unk> the fourth and v we come in a kind of differ univers <unk> the second and the third were build which were adapt into kill instal and there were all these awkward element in them for exampl that the kill took place underground and that burn took place abov ground here we have a complet ration design which accommod kill and burn in a logic wai the great advantag of have abov ground ga chamber wa that it actual allow for natur ventil in the kill process of cours the question is alwai how quickli after youv kill the victim can you <unk> the ga chamber in order to clean the ga chamber out and burn the corps and that is the reason there ar actual larg door in each of these ga chamber at the outsid as the final solut of the jewish problem is per definit a project of limit durat the german onli want to spend the absolut minimum amount of monei on it all the bit and piec which in some wai had facilit the work of the inciner in <unk> the second and the third were abandon on of the most tell bit is thi roller thei didnt have thi veri sophist kind of <unk> to move thing in it wa that you just move the corps over thi roller into the inciner <unk> thi is a real kill machin it ha no offici link anymor to the offici us of the camp as a prison of war camp by examin the camp record and more import the document for the transport suppli by the german railwai it is possibl to calcul the number of peopl murder in auschwitz it wa extrem difficult to estim how mani peopl came to the camp especi jew from variou european countri who were then led directli from the unload ramp to the ga chamber and kill sum up all the data from individu countri transport by transport i came to the number of on million three hundr thousand deport to thi camp follow that ad on the data concern <unk> to other camp escap veri few escap and veri few releas similarli we get a number of on million on hundr thousand kill in auschwitz in decemb of nineteen forti four the prison were evacu to other camp the soviet armi fought their wai into it in januari nineteen forti five the fight went on three dai three dai there were trench at the approach to the camp the first two kilomet awai with shell and tank dug in and thi had to be knock out and thi wasnt onli right by the camp but to the right and the left and i saw with my own ey thing which realli shock me i didnt expect to see such atroc i saw there with my own ey i saw children shoe on big rack littl boot arrang veri neatli that big for babi of eighteen month or two year then some a bit bigger all of them number and neatli arrang appar thei were prepar for transport to germani i saw box of spectacl frame spectacl all the peopl who wore them had been turn into ash at first i didnt believ it wa women hair a few ton at that moment i realli suffer and i swore that until the end of the war id kill german when auschwitz wa liber as soon as the enemi wa driven back from the town our polit command <unk> came there thei even came from the intern affair depart and the <unk> from <unk> and grab the document when the soviet armi occupi east germani the k g b went in search of those who had left their trademark in the camp and arriv in <unk> where the maker of the oven <unk> and son were base a russian g r u <unk> knock at the door of technic director <unk> braun kurt <unk> the chief <unk> engin karl <unk> the expert in the design of ventil and air extract system thei were taken to jail in <unk> and while thei were in <unk> by the wai their wive receiv full pai from the firm <unk> senior engin kurt <unk> wa interrog in <unk> which technic instal for the ga chamber were construct and instal by <unk> answer at first the ga chamber were call <unk> german wa <unk> in the morgu a ventil system wa instal and subsequ it becam clear to us that thi ga chamber wa us for the kill of human be there were other interrog of cours and it wa karl <unk> who wa interrog on dai prior to <unk> question what were you abl to observ when you were in the immedi vicin of a <unk> and in the ga chamber answer when i wa in auschwitz i could see at a distanc of twenti <unk> how s s men were drive a group of about three hundr men women and children in front of them i had observ all thi at about four p m on the follow dai i wa in the <unk> at ten a m and there i saw sixti corps men women and children of differ ag thei were ly on the ground and judg by their extern appear thei had been <unk> in the ga chamber <unk> wa sentenc to twenti five year and di in prison <unk> the ventil engin and braun the technic director were jail for fourteen year in moscow in nineteen fifti five thei were releas by the russian as part of a gener amnesti for german prison thei return to <unk> then disappear the compani of <unk> and son had made sever million reich mark in the year that thei had work for the s s it surviv in <unk> make brew equip and is now manag by the son of <unk> braun he refus to be film but did allow us to record thi statement we took over the complet build from <unk> our father you might sai historian must look into the past to go forward but i dont have the time or the leisur there onli on question i have to concern myself with turnov and the profit column in between if i took so much time to look into the damag done by thi firm then the bank would sai go home that it thi is quit trivial  the architect who had work so dilig to design the four <unk> and their ga chamber and whose signatur were on the draw were never round up <unk> the chief architect di in germani in nineteen fifti <unk> and <unk> went to austria and becam success architect until in nineteen seventi two thei were final brought to trial and charg with be war crimin in vienna in the counti court a trial start of the architect now you would expect that dure thi trial the document the actual blueprint would have been the center of attent the remark thing is that even in the trial of the architect the document were there but in fact thei didnt know how to interpret them <unk> and <unk> were found not guilti it is not possibl to sai that the verdict would have been ani differ todai but the research that robert van <unk> gerald fleme and other ar do in the long ignor file of auschwitz show that there were mani more peopl who were prepar to collabor with the genocid plan of the nazi and that thei were precis awar of the consequ of their action what thi new research make veri clear is that the holocaust wa not just the fring phenomenon that involv an isol few but it wa a wholesal larg scale oper that involv <unk> who had measur of respons that were divers some of whom knew exactli what wa happen and some of whom could have known and would have known if thei did not engag in the suppress the inner suppress of of of difficult inform as on of the wai of eas their own conscienc there is the beast in man and these thing could conceiv happen again at ani time anywher,
