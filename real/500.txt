<s> THE WHITE HOUSE WELCOMED THE UNITED NATIONS VOTE APPROVING MILITARY ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS ON HAITI BUT U. S. WARSHIPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT TO HAITIAN WATERS READY TO INTERCEPT AND SEARCH VESSELS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OIL OR GUNS FOR HAITI </s>
<s> HAITIAN PRESIDENT JEAN BERTRAND ARISTIDE PRAISED THE MOVE AND SAID IT WOULD SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO HAITI'S MILITARY </s>
<s> I AM QUITE SURE THE WAY WE ARE MOVING IS THE RIGHT WAY </s>
<s> BEFORE THOSE FOLKS THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE </s>

<s> THAT WILL WORK </s>
<s> SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT TOOK TWO FURTHER STEPS SENDING IN THIRTY ADDITIONAL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO BEEF UP THE U. S. EMBASSY SECURITY DETACHMENT IN HAITI'S CAPITAL </s>
