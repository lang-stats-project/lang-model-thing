<s> LISTEN TO THIS COMPOSITION BY PROFESSOR <UNK> <UNK> OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO </s>
<s> SOMETIMES IT'S SWEET AND FAMILIAR AT OTHER MOMENTS IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY OUT OF TUNE </s>
<s> IT'S FROM A NEW COMPACT DISC OF HIS WORK CALLED <UNK> AN <UNK> IN SIXTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> THE C. D. ALSO INCLUDES TWELVE <UNK> <UNK> A FANFARE IN NINETEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND A SUITE FOR GUITAR IN FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE MICRO <UNK> ARE IMAGINE A PIANO KEYBOARD </s>
<s> IN ANY OCTAVE SAY FROM MIDDLE C. TO HIGH C. THERE ARE TWELVE EQUAL STEPS </s>
<s> YOU GO UP SEVEN WHITE KEYS AND FIVE BLACK KEYS EACH KEY A HALF STEP AWAY FROM THE NEXT </s>
<s> THAT'S A STANDARD TWELVE TONE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> NOW IMAGINE THE SAME OCTAVE DIVIDED INTO MORE EQUAL STEPS SAY NINE WHITE KEYS AND SIX BLACKS KEYS </s>
<s> WELL THAT WOULD MAKE FIFTEEN NOTES TO THE OCTAVE INSTEAD OF THE FAMILIAR TWELVE </s>
<s> EACH STEP WOULD BE SMALLER THAN A HALF STEP HENCE MICRO <UNK> </s>
<s> MORE AND SMALLER STEPS MIGHT MAKE NINETEEN OR TWENTY NOTE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> MUSIC PLAYED IN ANY ONE OF THESE <UNK> WOULD SOUND DIFFERENT FROM THE MUSIC THAT WE USUALLY HEAR </s>
<s> <UNK> <UNK> UNDERTOOK A PROJECT SOME YEARS AGO ON A GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES TO WRITE MUSIC IN EVERY MICRO TUNING FROM THIRTEEN STEPS TO THE OCTAVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FOUR STEP TO THE OCTAVE </s>
<s> HE CAME TO OUR CHICAGO BUREAU TO ILLUSTRATE THE NOTES THAT YOU HEAR WHEN HE DIVIDES THE OCTAVE INTO FIFTEEN NOTES </s>
<s> NOW WHAT YOU CAN HEAR IS EACH ONE OF THE INTERVALS PLAYED FIRST THE LOWER NOTE AND THE HIGHER NOTE AND THEN THE TWO PLAYED TOGETHER AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IN CERTAIN CASES THE INTERVALS YOU HEAR SOUND RATHER LIKE THE ONE WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH BUT IN OTHER CASES THEY SOUND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT </s>
<s> AND THE FIRST ONE IS A LITTLE BIT ALIEN BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO </s>
<s> NOW THE SECOND ONE'S A LITTLE BIGGER A RATHER STRANGE SOUND </s>
<s> NOW A LITTLE BIGGER A VERY STRANGE SOUNDING ONE </s>
<s> THAT ONE SOUNDS FAMILIAR </s>
<s> THAT ONE SOUNDS FAMILIAR ALSO </s>
<s> NEXT ONE'S A BIT TWISTED </s>
<s> NOW THE NEXT ONE'S VERY WEIRD </s>
<s> THE NEXT ONE'S ALSO VERY WEIRD </s>
<s> NOW YOU GOT A MORE FAMILIAR ONE </s>
<s> ANOTHER FAMILIAR ONE </s>
<s> ANOTHER FAMILIAR ONE </s>
<s> NOW COMES A STRANGE ONE </s>
<s> ONE THAT'S NOT QUITE AS STRANGE </s>
<s> AND THEN FINALLY THE OCTAVE ITSELF </s>
<s> NOW WHEN YOU SAY THAT SOME OF THEM SOUND FAMILIAR AND OTHERS ARE VERY STRANGE IS THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MATHEMATICS OF DIVIDING THE DOUBLING THE FREQUENCY FROM A NOTE TO ITS TO ONE OCTAVE HIGHER THAT WE HIT STEPS THAT ARE THE VERY SAME STEPS AS THEY ARE IN THE TWELVE TONE </s>
<s> YES IN SOME CASES YOU DO </s>
<s> IF YOU STOP AND THINK FOR A MOMENT YOU CAN DIVIDE AN OCTAVE INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS WITH EITHER THE TWELVE NOTE DIVISION OR THE FIFTEEN NOTE DIVISION </s>
<s> AND SO THERE ARE TWO INTERVALS BESIDE THE OCTAVE ITSELF IN THAT ARRAY THAT ARE IN FACT IDENTICAL TO WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE PIANO </s>
<s> WELL THOSE ARE THE NOTES THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU DIVIDE THE OCTAVE INTO FIFTEEN STEPS INSTEAD OF TWELVE STEPS </s>
<s> NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING </s>
<s> YOU WROTE A COMPOSITION FOR TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING </s>
<s> THAT IS THE LAST OF THE REALLY EXTREMELY ALIEN ONES </s>
<s> THIS TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING WHEN I HEARD IT I KNEW IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING AND IT REMINDED ME A LITTLE BIT OF A SOUND OF ONE OF THESE INDONESIAN <UNK> ORCHESTRAS </s>
<s> YES WELL THERE WAS A THEORIST WHO A DUTCH THEORIST WHO LIVED IN INDONESIA FOR MANY YEARS WHO PUT FORTH THE HYPOTHESIS IN FACT THAT THE <UNK> MODES USED IN INDONESIA ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE TWENTY THREE NOTE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> NOW AT THE PRESENT TIME <UNK> AND SCHOLARS ARE NOT PERSUADED BY HIS ARGUMENT BUT I RATHER AM </s>
<s> NOW TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE FOR NINETEEN TONE </s>
<s> FOR NINETEEN NOTES YOU HAVE VERY <UNK> <UNK> AND IN FACT THEY ARE MORE <UNK> THAN WHAT IS FOUND ON THE PIANO KEYBOARD AND ALL OF THE COMMON <UNK> THAT YOU FIND IN CHRISTMAS CAROLS CO EXIST IN THE NINETEEN NOTE SCALE BUT IN EVEN MORE <UNK> VERSIONS </s>
<s> IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN JUST ABOUT TAKE A MANUAL OF CHRISTMAS CAROLS SIT AT A NINETEEN NOTE EQUAL INSTRUMENT AND PLAY THEM AND THEY SOUND A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER AND PRETTIER THAN THEY DO ON THE PIANO </s>
<s> THIS IS THE SCALE IN WHICH YOU WROTE THE FANFARE FOR THE CHICAGO RADIO STATION <UNK> </s>
<s> THAT'S RIGHT </s>
<s> AND EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN HOW CAN IT SOUND SMOOTHER AND <UNK> THAN THE VERY <UNK> FOR WHICH THE CHRISTMAS CAROL WAS WRITTEN </s>
<s> THE EQUAL TUNING ON THE PIANO DISTORTS THE TUNING OF THE <UNK> QUITE NOTICEABLY AND IN FACT IT'S THIS DISTORTION THAT A <UNK> LISTENS FOR WHEN HE TUNES A PIANO </s>
<s> IT'S TO GET THE WRONG INTERVALS WRONG IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY </s>
<s> SO IN A CERTAIN SENSE THERE IS AN IDEALISTIC OR <UNK> TUNING FOR A <UNK> WHICH ALL THESE EQUAL <UNK> CAN ONLY APPROXIMATE AND IT HAPPENS RATHER BY ACCIDENT THAT THE NINETEEN NOTE <UNK> IS SIMPLY CLOSER TO THE IDEAL THAN THE TWELVE NOTE <UNK> </s>
<s> NOW CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE TWELVE NOTE DIVISION IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S EVER BEEN USED THROUGHOUT MUSIC HISTORY </s>
<s> THERE WAS AN ECCENTRIC ITALIAN INTELLECTUAL WHO BUILT A THIRTY ONE NOTE EQUAL INSTRUMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY </s>
<s> AND IN FACT THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE TWELVE TONE TUNING CAME ABOUT MUCH LATER THAN HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN REALIZED </s>
<s> I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND THE SUITE FOR GUITAR THAT YOU WROTE FOR IT AND THAT IS ON THE COMPACT DISC THAT'S NOW BEEN RELEASED </s>
<s> HAVE YOU BEEN PRESENT TO WATCH AUDIENCES REACT TO THE LIVE PLAYING OF THIS PIECE IN FIFTEEN TONE EQUAL TUNING </s>
<s> I'VE NEVER SEEN IT PERFORMED BEFORE A LARGE AUDIENCE OF ORDINARY CONCERT GOERS </s>
<s> I'VE SEEN SMALLER AUDIENCES ON CAMPUSES BUT JEFFREY <UNK> THE GUITARIST TELLS ME HE PLAYED THE PIECE EXTENSIVELY IN GERMANY AND GOT NO PECULIAR REACTION TO IT AT ALL </s>
<s> AND YET NORMAN <UNK> AT <UNK> TELLS ME THAT ONE DAY HE PLAYED A PORTION OF THE PIECE AND FORGET TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WAS FOR FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND THE <UNK> LIT UP </s>
<s> YOU MEAN PEOPLE PEOPLE WERE CALLING IN TO SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RADIO STATION OR </s>
<s> SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG </s>
<s> THAT GUITAR IS OUT OF TUNE </s>
<s> AND TO BE SURE IN A CERTAIN SENSE IT IS OUT TUNE BUT THEN IN ANOTHER SENSE THE ORDINARY TWELVE NOTE GUITAR IS OUT OF TUNE ALSO </s>
<s> WE'RE JUST MORE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT ONE </s>
<s> WELL I MUST SAY I FOUND MYSELF LISTENING TO THE FIFTEEN NOTE TUNING AND NODDING AND HEARING IT AND IT SOUNDING RIGHT AND VERY PLEASANT TO ME </s>
<s> AND THEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A NOTE WOULD COME IN THAT SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT WAS IT JUST DIDN'T BELONG THERE </s>
<s> IT WAS SOME NOTE I WAS COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR WITH </s>
<s> WELL THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN THE FIFTEEN NOTE <UNK> WHERE I MIGHT MAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CHOICE IF I WERE GOING TO UNDERTAKE A REVISION OF THE PIECE </s>
<s> THERE'S A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE I MUST CONFESS THEY DISTURB ME ALSO </s>
<s> BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH SOUND DIFFERENT WHICH I DO NOT FIND DISTURBING </s>
<s> NOW CURIOUSLY ENOUGH WHEN THIS PROJECT WAS PEER REVIEWED AS ALL THE N. E. A. GRANTS ARE ONE OF THE RELATIVELY SYMPATHETIC PEER <UNK> WROTE BACK IN HIS EVALUATION THAT THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT THAT THE <UNK> OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NOTES WERE OF NO MUSICAL USE WHATEVER </s>
<s> DID YOU SAY THAT WAS ONE OF THE MORE SYMPATHETIC PEER <UNK> </s>
<s> THAT WAS ONE OF THE MORE SYMPATHETIC ONES AND I HONESTLY DO THINK THAT I HAVE MANAGED TO DISPROVE HIS STATEMENT </s>
