<s> C. N. N.'S TONY CLARK HAS THE DETAILS </s>
<s> FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR WOODROW <UNK> WALKED OUT OF THE COURTHOUSE A FREE MAN </s>
<s> HE WAS ONE OF FOUR BRANCH DAVIDIANS FOUND NOT GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES </s>
<s> NO I DO NOT HOLD IT AGAINST ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM WHAT WOULD THIS WORLD BE </s>
