<s> THIS IS JOHN COCHRAN ON CAPITOL HILL WHERE OVERNIGHT OPINIONS HAD HARDENED AND BOB DOLE WHO ONLY YESTERDAY SPOKE OF A LITTLE STRAIN IN RELATIONS WITH RUSSIAN TODAY CALLED FOR A SUSPENSION OF AID UNLESS RUSSIA <UNK> AND STOPS SPYING </s>
<s> THIS AFFAIR THREATENS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC OF RUSSIA </s>
<s> THE DEMOCRAT WHO HEADS THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ALSO CALLED FOR A FREEZE WHICH WILL PLEASE SOME FOLKS BACK HOME </s>
<s> IN MY STATE ALREADY I'M ASKED YOU KNOW WHY DID YOU SUPPORT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR RUSSIA </s>
<s> WE SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN FOR FOOLS </s>
<s> THERE'S NO SENSE IN GIVING AID TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO SPY ON US </s>
<s> THE FACT THAT IT'S AN AMERICAN ACCUSED OF SPYING SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE </s>
<s> THE CASE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON WHO BEFORE LAST MONTH'S TRIP TO MOSCOW URGED CONGRESS TO CONTINUE A FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGE EVEN THOUGH CLINTON HAD BEEN BRIEFED ON RUSSIAN SPYING </s>
<s> SO FAR CLINTON IS RESISTING PRESSURE TO SUSPEND AID </s>
<s> MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENT AID IS IN THE FORM OF AID TO TAKE DOWN THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS </s>
<s> AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS WE SHOULD SLOW THAT UP </s>
<s> BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS TALK SHOWS HAD SOMETHING BESIDES TONYA AND NANCY TO DISCUSS </s>
<s> I THINK THAT AS FAR AS RUSSIA'S CONCERNED THE NEXT TIME THEY WANT A FEW TONS OF WHEAT WE SHOULD TELL THEM TO GROW IT THEMSELVES </s>
<s> IN RUSSIA AN INTELLIGENCE SPOKESMAN SAID AMERICANS ARE TYPICALLY OVERREACTING </s>
<s> WE DON'T MAKE A BIG FUSS OUT OF IT </s>
<s> WHY SHOULD AMERICANS USE THE OCCASION JUST TO PROVOKE TENSION BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES </s>
<s> EVEN CONGRESS ADMITS THE RUSSIANS ARE ONLY DOING WHAT AMERICANS SPIES DO </s>
<s> AS SENATOR EXON FROM NEBRASKA SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE SPIES OVER THERE THEN WE SHOULD HAVE </s>
