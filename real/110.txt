<s> BUT SEVEN OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES WERE AMONG MICHAEL <UNK> TEN BEST STATES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT </s>
<s> NOT ONLY THAT BUT SEVEN OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES WERE AMONG GEORGE MCGOVERN'S TOP TEN STATES BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO </s>
<s> IN OTHER WORDS CLINTON IS DOING BEST IN THE SAME STATES WHERE DUKAKIS AND MCGOVERN DID BEST </s>
<s> NOW CLINTON AND GORE ARE BOTH SOUTHERN WHITE BAPTISTS LIKE JIMMY CARTER </s>
<s> BUT CARTER THE LAST DEMOCRAT TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY GOT ELECTED ON A SOUTHERN STRATEGY </s>
<s> THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WHAT BILL CLINTON IS DOING </s>
<s> WELL CAN YOU DEFINE ANY SORT OF COALITION THEN THAT CLINTON SEEMS TO BE PUTTING TOGETHER </s>
<s> WELL CATHERINE HERE'S SOMETHING ODD </s>
<s> ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT CARRIED SEVENTEEN STATES IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY </s>
<s> EIGHT OF THOSE STATES THAT LINCOLN CARRIED ARE NOW SOLID CLINTON STATES </s>
<s> THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND A SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S </s>
<s> A COINCIDENCE </s>
<s> NOT REALLY </s>
<s> IN ITS EARLY DAYS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS A LIBERAL ANTI SLAVERY PARTY </s>
<s> IT WAS BUILT ON A BEDROCK OF YANKEE VOTES IN THE NORTHEAST THE UPPER MIDWEST AND THE PACIFIC COAST </s>
<s> THE NORTHERN LIBERAL VOTE REMAINED THE CORE REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE NEW DEAL IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES </s>
<s> RIGHT NOW BILL CLINTON IS DOING BEST IN THE NORTHEAST AND ON THE WEST COAST </s>
<s> THEY ARE THE MOST LIBERAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TWO COASTS HAVE SUFFERED MOST FROM THE WORST ECONOMIES OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS </s>
<s> BUSH IS RUNNING A CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN UNLIKE GERALD FORD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX </s>
<s> AND BUSH IS RUNNING BEST IN THE SOUTH </s>
<s> IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW NORTHERN LIBERAL COALITION </s>
<s> WE SAW IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO FOR MCGOVERN AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR DUKAKIS </s>
<s> BUT THE DEMOCRATS LOST BOTH OF THOSE ELECTIONS </s>
<s> IF CLINTON WINS THIS YEAR CATHERINE IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THE DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE PRESIDENCY WITH THIS NEW COALITION </s>
<s> WELL MAYBE INSTEAD OF THE HARRY TRUMAN ANALOGY WE NEED AN ABE LINCOLN ANALOGY </s>
<s> YES </s>
<s> RIGHT </s>
<s> BILL SCHNEIDER THANKS VERY MUCH </s>
<s> AND NEXT ON INSIDE POLITICS AND LONG AND MONOTONOUS WAY TO COMMUNITY CLINICS FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION BUT CAN'T AFFORD IT </s>
