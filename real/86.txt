<s> JAPAN'S GOVERNMENT IS GIVING SOME PLOTS OF LAND AWAY AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO LURE YOUNG PEOPLE BACK TO THE FARM LIFE </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S EILEEN O'CONNOR REPORTS </s>
<s> THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN NURTURED NOT BY THE YOUNG BUT BY THE OLD </s>
<s> MICHIKO WAS BORN IN THE <UNK> ERA MASAKO WAS TOO </s>
<s> THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR GRANDCHILDREN TO SEW THESE FIELDS AND KEEP THE LAND AS IT IS AND AS IT WAS FOR GENERATIONS </s>
<s> MY SONS TELL ME DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LAND JUST LEAVE IT SAYS MICHIKO BUT BOTH OF THEM WORK FOR COMPANIES </s>
<s> SO IT IS LEFT TO THE ELDERLY TO WORRY AND CARE FOR THIS LAND </s>
<s> MASAKO KNOWS THE <UNK> OF A GOOD HARVEST AND THE PLEASURE OF LIVING WITH NATURE </s>
<s> WE HAVE NO CHOICE SHE SAID </s>
<s> YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT </s>
<s> BUT THAT CHOICE IS WORRYING EVEN THE GOVERNMENT </s>
<s> ON SOME AREAS LAND IS BEING GIVEN AWAY TO LURE THE YOUNG BACK TO THE EARTH </s>
<s> JAPAN HAS ALWAYS SUBSIDIZED ITS FARMERS SO AS NOT TO RELY ON OUTSIDERS FOR RICE </s>
<s> BUT IT MAY BE THAT MONEY ALONE WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT SELF <UNK> IN THE FUTURE FOR IT IS PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED </s>
<s> WHEN I WAS A SMALL CHILD I HELPED MY PARENTS PLANT THE RICE BY HAND SAYS MICHIKO ONE BY ONE </s>
<s> NOW IT IS MACHINERY THAT RUNS IN THE FIELDS NOT THE CHILDREN </s>
<s> BUT STILL THE ELDERLY BELIEVES THAT TRADITION WILL NOT DIE THAT THE ERA OF THE JAPANESE RICE FARMER IS NOT OVER YET </s>
