<s> HAVING A COUPLE OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS EACH DAY CAN MAKE UP LESS PRONE TO HEART DISEASE </s>
<s> THAT IS SOMETHING SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS </s>
<s> BUT NOW A NEW STUDY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S ELIZABETH SCHWARTZ HAS THE STORY </s>
<s> WHAT DOES A BLOODY MARY HAVE IN COMMON WITH THIS MEDICINE </s>
<s> ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY BOTH THE DRUG AND THE DRINK BOOST THE AMOUNT OF AN ENZYME THAT HELPS BREAK DOWN THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE </s>
<s> THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DRINKING MORE SEEM TO BE PRODUCING MORE OF THIS POTENTIALLY PROTECTIVE ENZYME </s>
<s> DOCTORS GIVE THE DRUG IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS AFTER SOMEONE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK </s>
<s> BUT THE STUDY SHOWS THAT MODERATE DRINKING COULD HELP PREVENT HEART DISEASE </s>
<s> THE HARVARD MEDICINE SCHOOL REPORT PUBLISHED IN THIS WEEK'S JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION LOOKED AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MALE PHYSICIANS </s>
<s> THE ONES WHO DRANK TWO OR MORE DRINKS A DAY HAD A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE PROTECTIVE ENZYME THAN THOSE WHO DRANK ONE TO SIX DRINKS A WEEK OR ONE TO THREE DRINKS A MONTH OF WHO RARELY OR NEVER DRANK </s>
<s> SO DOES THIS MEAN THE MORE YOU DRINK THE HEALTHIER YOU'LL BE </s>
<s> NOT ON YOUR LIFE </s>
<s> TWO DRINKS A DAY SEEMS TO WORK JUST FINE </s>
<s> WHAT LOOKS CLEAR IS THAT THE MORE YOU DRINK THINGS DON'T GET BETTER </s>
<s> THIS IS A CLEAR ISSUE OF MODERATION IS THE WAY TO GO HERE </s>
<s> IN FACT YEARS OF EXCESSIVE DRINKING CAN CAUSE HEART DISEASE </s>
<s> ALL IN ALL SOME ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ALCOHOL FROM DISEASES LIKE CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER TO CAR ACCIDENTS </s>
<s> DOCTORS SAY THE NEXT STEP IS TO DEVELOP A PILL THAT WOULD HAVE ALL THE GOOD AFFECTS OF ALCOHOL WITHOUT ANY OF THE BAD AFFECTS </s>
<s> AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE AS MUCH FUND AS HAVING A FEW DRINKS IT COULD BE A LOT SAFER </s>
<s> BYRON WILLIAMS A CARDIOLOGIST IN ATLANTA SAYS HE'S WAITING FOR JUST THAT KIND OF MEDICINE </s>
<s> FOR NOW HE RECOMMENDS MODERATE DRINKING ONLY AFTER CHECKING A PATIENT'S FAMILY AND PERSONAL HISTORY OF ALCOHOLISM </s>
<s> HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BENIGN FORM OF ALCOHOL IF YOU WILL AND WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT DOSE IS AND BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE THAT FOR THE PATIENT </s>
<s> IN THE MEANTIME IT SEEMS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A BIT OF BOTTOMS UP </s>
<s> BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE AN ALL NIGHT PARTY OUT OF IT </s>
