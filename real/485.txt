<s> WITH GOOD REASON SYLVESTER STALLONE AND WESLEY SNIPES <UNK> THEIR MUSCLES FOR A BOX OFFICE RECORD THIS WEEKEND </s>
<s> OUR MOVIE ANALYST MARTIN GROVE JOINS US NOW TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT </s>
<s> HI MARTIN </s>
<s> HI JIM </s>
<s> YOU KNOW WITH GROSSES LIKE THESE YOU'D THINK IT WAS STILL SUMMER </s>
<s> NOW DEMOLITION MAN DEMOLISHED THE RECORD FOR THE BEST FALL OPENING EVER WHILE ALSO <UNK> SYLVESTER STALLONE'S CAREER COMEBACK PROVING THAT HIS FANS WILL LINE UP TO SEE HIM IN ACTION </s>
<s> DEMOLITION MAN IS THE KIND OF ACTION PACKED PICTURE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE RELEASED DURING EITHER THE SUMMER OR CHRISTMAS SEASONS WHEN MOVIEGOING PEAKS </s>
<s> BUT BY OPENING IN THE FALL WARNER BROTHERS WAS ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON LESS COMPETITION AND LOWER EXPECTATIONS </s>
<s> IN ADDITION SINCE THE FILM OPENED ON COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND WITH MONDAY BEING A DAY OFF FOR MANY PEOPLE IN BOTH THE U. S. AND CANADA DEMOLITION MAN BENEFITED FROM WELL ABOVE AVERAGE SUNDAY NIGHT BUSINESS </s>
<s> AND THOUGH MOST CRITICS FOUND THE FILM TO BE LACKING IN THE STORY DEPARTMENT A WELL ORCHESTRATED MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOCUSING ON THE MOVIE'S ACTION WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DRAWING YOUNG MALES TO THEATERS </s>
<s> INTERESTINGLY THIS IS THE SAME STRATEGY WARNER BROTHERS CLEVERLY USED LAST YEAR FOR THE PREVIOUS OCTOBER RECORD HOLDER UNDER SIEGE </s>
<s> ELSEWHERE IT WAS SMOOTH SLEDDING IN WEEK TWO FOR DISNEY'S COMEDY COOL <UNK> </s>
<s> IN FACT THE WEEKEND WAS GREAT FOR THE MOVIE BUSINESS IN GENERAL </s>
<s> UP NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OVER LAST YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE </s>
<s> COOL <UNK> IS ATTRACTING FAMILY AUDIENCES </s>
<s> MALICE AND THE GOOD SON ARE A HIT WITH ADULTS AND THE AGE OF INNOCENCE AND THE JOY LUCK CLUB WHICH APPEAL TO ADULT FEMALES ARE ALSO KEEPING BOX OFFICE CASH REGISTERS RINGING </s>
<s> THIS WEEKEND'S OTHER NOTABLE OPENING WAS GETTYSBURG FROM NEW LINE CINEMA AND TURNER PICTURES </s>
<s> DESPITE BEING LIMITED TO ONLY ONE SHOWING PER NIGHT DUE TO ITS FOUR AND A HALF HOUR LENGTH THE PICTURE MANAGED TO <UNK> RAKE IN NEARLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON ONLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR SCREENS </s>
<s> THAT IS IMPRESSIVE </s>
