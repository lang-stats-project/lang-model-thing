<s> THERE'S BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUSION ENERGY </s>
<s> FUSION HOLD THE PROMISE OF A NEVER ENDING POWER SUPPLY AND UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY THERE WOULD BE NO POLLUTION </s>
<s> BUT AS C. N. N.'S HARLEY HOTCHKISS REPORTS A CHANGE OVER TO FUSION ENERGY WON'T BE HAPPENING ANY TIME SOON </s>
<s> SCIENTISTS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WERE FIRED UP THURSDAY NIGHT </s>
<s> THEY CHEERED THE SUCCESS OF A FOUR SECOND FUSION REACTION THAT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL EVER CREATED BY SCIENTISTS </s>
<s> I THINK THIS IS A HISTORIC MILESTONE IN FUSION ENERGY DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE WRIGHT BROTHERS' FIRST FLIGHT </s>
<s> WHY ALL THE HOOPLA </s>
<s> BECAUSE FUSION IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF ENERGY </s>
<s> IT PROMISES A CLEAN AND NEARLY ENDLESS SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY </s>
<s> FUSION FUELS THE SUN WITH THE NON STOP MEANS OF TREMENDOUS ENERGY </s>
<s> SCIENTISTS HOPE TO MIMIC THE SUN HERE ON EARTH IN FUSION REACTORS </s>
<s> THE FUEL FOR FUSION POWER PLANTS WOULD NOT COME FROM COAL GAS OR RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL BUT FROM WATER </s>
<s> HYDROGEN ATOMS FROM WATER CAN BE FORCED TOGETHER UNTIL THEY LITERALLY FUSE </s>
<s> THIS RESULTS IN THE RELEASE OF ENERGY </s>
<s> NUCLEAR FUSION REACTORS WOULD NOT CREATE THE HAZARDS OR DANGEROUS WASTES THAT COME FROM NUCLEAR <UNK> THE ATOM SPLITTING PROCESS THAT RUNS NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND GIVES ATOMIC WEAPONS THEIR DESTRUCTIVE FORCE </s>
<s> WHILE THE RECORD REACTION OFFERS ENCOURAGING NEWS THE HUGE PRINCETON REACTOR ACTUALLY CONSUMED EIGHT TIMES MORE ENERGY THAN IT CREATED </s>
<s> THAT'S BECAUSE THE REACTOR HAD TO BE HEATED TO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DEGREES FAHRENHEIT TO TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF ENERGY </s>
<s> THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THIS BILLION DOLLAR EFFORT </s>
<s> AND SECRETARY OF ENERGY HAZEL O'LEARY IS GLAD TO SEE SOME RETURN ON INVESTMENT </s>
<s> PART OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT OFTEN A LARGE INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE HAS A TREMENDOUSLY LONG PERIOD BEFORE WE SEE PAYOFF IN BENEFIT </s>
<s> AND THIS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE CASE WITH THIS PROJECT </s>
<s> OH FUSION </s>
<s> OH WE'VE BEEN FUNDING THIS FOREVER </s>
<s> SO AFTER THE SIGH OF RELIEF IS LIKE <UNK> </s>
<s> DESPITE THE CURRENT SUCCESS SCIENTISTS SAY IT'LL TAKE DECADES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEFORE FUSION REACTORS CAN BE MADE TO CREATE ELECTRICITY CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY </s>
