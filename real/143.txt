<s> ANOTHER U. S. COMPUTER MAKER ABOUT TO LAUNCH A SALVO IN THE JAPANESE MARKET BY OFFERING MORE COMPUTER FOR LESS MONEY </s>
<s> COMPAQ COMPUTER TODAY WILL DRASTICALLY UNDERCUT PERSONAL COMPUTER PRICES IN JAPAN </s>
<s> THAT MOVE COULD START A PRICE WAR IN THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER MARKET </s>
<s> TODD BENJAMIN REPORTS FROM TOKYO </s>
<s> COMPAQ ISN'T A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN JAPAN BUT THE HOUSTON BASED COMPUTER COMPANY WELL KNOWN FOR ITS AGGRESSIVE PRICING IN THE UNITED STATES NOW HAS ITS SITES SET ON JAPAN </s>
<s> THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE JAPANESE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN PAYING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR </s>
<s> SO I THINK IT IS FAIR TO OFFER THE BEST QUALITY PRODUCTS AT THE YOU KNOW THE BEST PRICE </s>
<s> <UNK> CHEAPEST MODEL IN JAPAN WILL SELL FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND YEN OR JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS </s>
<s> THAT'S ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE LOWEST PRICED MACHINE OFFERED BY N. E. C. THE MARKET LEADER </s>
<s> COMPAQ ALSO <UNK> THE COMPETITION ON OTHER P. C. MACHINES IT OFFERS IN HOPES ITS LOW PRICED STRATEGY WILL BE AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE WORD PROCESSING CROWD </s>
<s> N. E. C. SAYS ITS PRICING WON'T BE AFFECTED BY <UNK> MORE MACHINE FOR LESS MONEY MOVE </s>
<s> JAPAN UNLIKE THE UNITED STATES HASN'T EXPERIENCED FIERCE PRICE WARS BUT COMPAQ COULD CHANGE THAT </s>
<s> I DON'T THINK THE IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING TO BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY </s>
<s> IT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BUT YOU'LL SEE THE MARKET SHARES BEGIN TO DETERIORATE FOR THE JAPANESE MAJORS UNLESS THEY COME OUT WITH A VERY AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGY </s>
<s> COMPAQ WHICH BEGAN SELLING PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN JAPAN EARLIER THIS YEAR HAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF A MARKET VALUED AT FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS </s>
<s> N. E. C. HAS OVER FIFTY PERCENT </s>
<s> WHILE JAPAN THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER MARKET OFFERS MUCH PROMISE <UNK> AGGRESSIVE MOVE INTO THE MARKET COMES AT A TIME WHEN MAKING SIGNIFICANT HEADWAY COULD BE TOUGH </s>
<s> JAPAN IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND COMPUTER SALES ARE DOWN </s>
