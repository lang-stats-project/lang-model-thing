<s> A STUDY OF A PROMISING NEW DRUG FOR TREATING HEPATITIS B. HAS BEEN STOPPED AFTER TWO PATIENTS IN THE STUDY DIED </s>
<s> SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WHICH WAS DIRECTING THE STUDY ARE NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG </s>
<s> NPR'S JOE PALCA HAS A REPORT ON THEIR INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE INFECTED WITH THE HEPATITIS B. VIRUS </s>
<s> IN AMERICA IT'S SPREAD PRIMARILY BY SEXUAL CONTACT AND THROUGH BLOOD </s>
<s> WHILE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WILL REMAIN SYMPTOM FREE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES MANY CAN EXPERIENCE SEVERE LIVER DAMAGE AND THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE VIRUS CAN CAUSE LIVER CANCER SO DOCTORS ARE ANXIOUS TO FIND MORE EFFECTIVE DRUGS TO TREAT CHRONIC HEPATITIS B. INFECTION </s>
<s> ALLAN WEINSTEIN VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH AT ELI LILLY SAYS HIS COMPANY THOUGHT A COMPOUND CALLED <UNK> OR <UNK> WAS THE ANSWER </s>
<s> IT HAD BEEN TESTED IN THE TEST TUBE FIRST AND THEN IN ANIMALS AND FOUND TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN KILLING THE VIRUS SUBSEQUENTLY WAS TESTED IN HUMAN BEINGS PRIMARILY AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND IN THE TRIALS THAT WERE DONE BEFORE WAS FOUND TO BE VERY PROMISING IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO TREAT THIS CHRONIC INFECTION AND AT THE TIME VERY FREE OF SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS </s>
<s> IN FACT INITIAL RESULTS FROM SIXTY FIVE PATIENTS WERE SO PROMISING AND SAFE THAT LILLY HAD PLANS TO START A LARGE SCALE STUDY INVOLVING HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY LATER THIS YEAR </s>
<s> BUT FIRST SCIENTISTS WANTED TO KNOW HOW PATIENTS WOULD TOLERATE THE DRUG OVER PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME </s>
<s> IN THE INITIAL TESTS PATIENTS ONLY TOOK THE DRUG FOR FOUR WEEKS </s>
<s> A STUDY INVOLVING TWENTY PATIENTS BEGAN THIS SPRING </s>
<s> THIS TRIAL WAS STOPPED ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS WHEN WE RECOGNIZED THIS OVERWHELMING UNEXPECTED SUDDEN TOXICITY OF THIS ANTI VIRAL AGENT </s>
<s> JAY <UNK> WAS DIRECTING THE TRIAL AT N. I. H. </s>
<s> HE SAYS EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING GOOD IN THE INITIAL WEEKS </s>
<s> THERE WERE NO SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE DRUG AND BLOOD TESTS INDICATED THAT THE DRUG WAS WORKING DRIVING THE VIRUS FROM PATIENTS' BODIES </s>
<s> BUT THEN EARLY SATURDAY MORNING TWO WEEKS AGO A PATIENT CAME TO THE HOSPITAL SUFFERING FROM LIVER FAILURE PARTIAL KIDNEY FAILURE AND DAMAGE TO MUSCLE AND NERVES </s>
<s> SO IT WAS A SUDDEN SEVERE MULTI SYSTEM TOXICITY THAT APPEARED AND WITH THAT WE CALLED EVERY PATIENT ON THIS DRUG AND TOLD THEM TO STOP IMMEDIATELY AND TO COME IN TO SEE US </s>
<s> ALL TEN PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN TAKING <UNK> FOR MORE THAN TWELVE WEEKS WERE HOSPITALIZED </s>
<s> THREE WERE SENT FOR EMERGENCY LIVER TRANSPLANTS TWO DIED FIVE ARE STILL HOSPITALIZED AND THREE ARE WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN HOME </s>
<s> <UNK> WEINSTEIN SAYS THERE ARE SOME CLUES ABOUT WHY THE PATIENTS GOT SO SICK </s>
<s> DRUGS SUCH AS THIS AND BY THAT I MEAN DRUGS THAT ARE CHEMICALLY SIMILAR TO THIS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SOME INJURY TO A VERY SMALL PARTICLE INSIDE CELLS WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING MACHINE OF THE CELL </s>
<s> A STRUCTURE CALLED <UNK> AND THIS HAS BEEN SEEN WITH OTHER RELATED DRUGS </s>
<s> FOR EXAMPLE A. Z. T. WHICH IS USED FOR H. I. V. INFECTION </s>
<s> BOTH A. Z. T. AND <UNK> ARE FROM A CLASS OF DRUGS CALLED <UNK> <UNK> </s>
<s> ONLY <UNK> HAS SHOWN THIS KIND OF SEVERE DAMAGE TO <UNK> BUT JAY <UNK> SAYS IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO WATCH FOR THIS DAMAGE WHEN TESTING OTHER <UNK> <UNK> IN THE FUTURE </s>
<s> N. I. H. SCIENTISTS OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE DRUG COMPANY ARE REVIEWING ALL ASPECTS OF THE <UNK> STUDY BUT <UNK> SAYS DESPITE ITS PROMISING START THE DRUG HAS NO FUTURE </s>
<s> I CAN'T IMAGINE USING IT IN HUMANS ANY MORE </s>
<s> I WOULD HOPE THAT SYSTEMS WOULD BE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD DETECT THIS TOXICITY SOME KIND OF CELL SYSTEM OR ANIMAL SYSTEM SO THAT IT WHEN NEW <UNK> <UNK> COME ALONG THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WILL NOT BE REPEATED </s>
