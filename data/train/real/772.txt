<s> POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OR P. C. R. TESTING WHAT IT USUALLY DOES IS TELL WHETHER A PERSON IS EXCLUDED THAT THE PERSON COULD NOT BE THE SOURCE OF A BLOOD SAMPLE BEING EXAMINED FROM A CRIME SCENE </s>
<s> BUT IT CANNOT TELL IF THE SAMPLE CAME FROM A PARTICULAR PERSON AND THAT'S WHY SOME LEGAL EXPERTS SAY </s>
