<s> ONE THING BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THEIR MILITARY HISTORY THOUGH THE STORIES THEY TELL ARE VERY DIFFERENT </s>
<s> CLINTON IS STILL EXPLAINING HIS LACK OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH IS STILL EXPLOITING HIS DISTINGUISHED MILITARY SERVICE </s>
<s> REVEALING OR IRRELEVANT </s>
<s> THE STORY FROM C. N. N.'S MARY TILLOTSON </s>
<s> BILL CLINTON'S DRAFT RECORD IS HANGING OVER HIS HEAD LITERALLY </s>
<s> A SMALL PLANE HAS TAKEN TO FOLLOWING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TRAILING THE SAME MESSAGE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN <UNK> THAT BILL CLINTON AVOIDED SERVING IN VIETNAM </s>
<s> IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY </s>
<s> WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THESE BIG PROBLEMS BUT NOW IT'S A PROBLEM OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND CREDIBILITY </s>
<s> WHO'S GOING TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO'S GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES </s>
<s> REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND WAR HERO BOB DOLE TOOK TO THE SENATE FLOOR TO SLAM CLINTON FOR HIS CONFLICTING STATEMENTS ABOUT CLINTON'S DRAFT STATUS IN THE VIETNAM ERA </s>
<s> THAT WAS A CENTRAL THEME OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S LABOR DAY CAMPAIGN KICKOFF IN WISCONSIN </s>
<s> AND HARRY TRUMAN WANTED TO JOIN THE MILITARY AND FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY AND SO DO I AND I DID </s>
<s> HARRY TRUMAN WAS A MAN OF DECISIVENESS NOT EQUIVOCATION </s>
<s> HE'D FIND LITTLE IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNOR CLINTON A MAN WHO <UNK> OR DUCKS ON ALMOST EVERY TOUGH ISSUE </s>
<s> MAX <UNK> FORMER HEAD OF THE VETERAN'S ADMINISTRATION TRIPLE <UNK> FROM VIETNAM AND DEMOCRAT SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE FOCUSING ON VIETNAM TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS </s>
<s> ESPECIALLY FOR DAN QUAYLE TO THROW ROCKS AT BILL CLINTON OR THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET FOR FAILURE TO GO TO VIETNAM IS LIKE A FROG CALLING SOMEBODY ELSE UGLY </s>
<s> I MEAN DAN QUAYLE DOESN'T HAVE LIVES IS A GLASS HOUSE IN TERMS OF SERVICE IN VIETNAM </s>
<s> ONE OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS WHO WORKED HARDEST TO GET A FEDERAL MEMORIAL BUILT TO THAT WAR IS JAN SCRUGGS </s>
<s> SCRUGGS SAYS QUESTIONING CLINTON'S RECORD LIKE QUESTIONS FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT WHY DAN QUAYLE DID NOT SERVE IN VIETNAM ARE PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE </s>
<s> BUT SCRUGGS DOUBTS IT IS THE BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE FOR MOST FOLKS </s>
<s> TO MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA IT'S THEIR JOB AND THEIR FAMILY AND WHETHER THEY CAN EARN A LIVING AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR ECONOMIC WELL BEING THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE </s>
<s> SCRUGGS SAYS THE CONTINUING INTEREST IN AND ANGER ABOUT WHO DID WHAT DURING VIETNAM IS A SURE SIGN AS HE PUTS IT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HEALING TO BE DONE FROM THAT CONFLICT </s>
<s> ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THE MOST DIVISIVE WAR IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY STILL IS </s>
