<s> IN CHINA IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING AND POLITICALLY RISKY CHALLENGES FACING REFORMERS OVERCOMING THE HARD LINE POLICIES AND ATTITUDES GOVERNING STATE RUN INDUSTRY </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S MIKE CHINOY EXAMINES THE ISSUE IN TODAY'S SEGMENT OF OUR SERIES THE DRAGON STIRS </s>
<s> THERE ARE VERY FEW CITIES IN CHINA THESE DAYS WITH STATUES OF CHAIRMAN MAO IN THE MAIN SQUARE </s>
<s> <UNK> IS ONE OF THEM </s>
<s> THE SYMBOLISM IS APPROPRIATE </s>
<s> WITH ITS FOREST OF SMOKESTACKS THIS INDUSTRIAL CENTER IN NORTHEASTERN CHINA IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORST OF COMMUNIST ECONOMICS </s>
<s> MOST OF ITS ENTERPRISES ARE RUN BY THE STATE </s>
<s> THEY ARE <UNK> UNPRODUCTIVE INEFFICIENT AND IN THE RED </s>
<s> IT'S THE SAME STORY THROUGHOUT CHINA </s>
<s> DESPITE EMPLOYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS STATE RUN INDUSTRIES ARE NOW BEING DRAMATICALLY OUT PERFORMED BY CHINA'S SMALLER BUT RAPIDLY GROWING PRIVATE SECTOR </s>
<s> TWO THIRDS OF ALL OUR STATE RUN ENTERPRISES ARE LOSING MONEY </s>
<s> THEY ARE SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT </s>
<s> THEY FEATURE THE SO CALLED IRON RICE BOWL GUARANTEED LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT SO THE WORKERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO WORK AND THE MANAGERS HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO MANAGE </s>
<s> ALMOST EVERYONE IN CHINA AGREES THAT STATE RUN INDUSTRIES ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF CHANGE </s>
<s> BUT SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL HAS PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING AND POLITICALLY RISKY CHALLENGES FACING CHINA'S REFORMERS </s>
<s> THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF THE <UNK> REFRIGERATOR FACTORY </s>
<s> AFTER YEARS OF TURNING OUT SHINY MERCHANDISE AND LOSING MONEY THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY LET IT GO BANKRUPT </s>
<s> FOR PEOPLE LIKE LIU <UNK> WHO HAD WORKED AT THE FACTORY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT MEANT THE END OF CRADLE TO GRAVE SECURITY </s>
<s> SUDDENLY I HAD NO INCOME </s>
<s> I HAD TO FEND FOR MYSELF AND LOOK FOR A JOB </s>
<s> LIU WAS LUCKY HIS FACTORY'S ASSETS WERE TAKEN OVER BY A SMALL BUT SUCCESSFUL JOINT VENTURE PLANT </s>
<s> HE AND SOME OTHER WORKERS WERE GIVEN NEW JOBS </s>
<s> BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SO FORTUNATE </s>
<s> EVERY DAY GROUPS OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE GATHER ON THIS STREET SEEKING JOBS AS DAY LABORERS </s>
<s> MOST OF THEM ARE VICTIMS OF DECISIONS MADE HERE IN THE <UNK> BANKRUPTCY OFFICE WHICH HAS SO FAR ALLOWED TWENTY SEVEN STATE RUN FIRMS TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS </s>
<s> A TINY HANDFUL BUT A RECORD IN CHINA </s>
<s> THE MAIN PROBLEM IS WHAT TO DO WITH WORKERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM </s>
<s> IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS TOO HIGH THEN YOU'LL GET SOCIAL PROBLEMS </s>
<s> WE NEED TO AVOID THIS </s>
<s> IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVE A DECADE AGO TO BREAK UP THE PEOPLE'S COMMUNES AND ALLOW THE REVIVAL OF PRIVATE FARMING PRODUCED NOT UNREST BUT A BOON </s>
<s> BUT IN THE MORE POLITICALLY VOLATILE CITIES THE AUTHORITIES CAUGHT BETWEEN THE DEMANDS OF ECONOMIC LOGIC AND THE RISKS OF WORKER UNREST CONTINUE TO TREAD <UNK> </s>
<s> THE IRON RICE BOWL IS CRACKING BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN SHATTERED INTO PIECES </s>
