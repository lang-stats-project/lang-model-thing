<s> IN THESE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW BUSINESS WORKS AND I WOULD HOPE TO SPEND A LOT OF MY TIME ON BRINGING BEST BUSINESS PRACTICES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE </s>
<s> MY SENSE IN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY IS THAT THE PUBLIC IS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING OVERSEAS OR OUR COMMITMENTS THAN WHETHER WE ARE GETTING A DOLLAR VALUE FOR A DOLLAR SPENT IN DEFENSE </s>
