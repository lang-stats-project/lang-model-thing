<s> PALESTINIANS EAGER FOR AUTONOMY CHEERED THE ARRIVAL OF A FORCE OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TODAY IN THE WEST BANK CITY OF HEBRON </s>
<s> BUT THAT WARM WELCOME ENDED QUICKLY AS NEW VIOLENCE ERUPTED BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS </s>
<s> A. B. C.'S DEAN REYNOLDS REPORTS </s>
<s> THEY ARE CALLED A TEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE CITY OF HEBRON </s>
<s> A HUNDRED OR SO NORWEGIANS DANES AND ITALIANS SHOWED UP TODAY WITH THE BLESSING OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT </s>

<s> THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE THAT FEELING TO THE PALESTINIANS OF HEBRON THIRTY OF WHOM WERE KILLED TEN WEEKS AGO BY A JEWISH SETTLER </s>
<s> IT IS THE FIRST TIME ISRAEL HAS EVER PERMITTED A FOREIGN FORCE ONTO LAND IT OCCUPIES </s>
<s> THE MEN IN WHITE SAY THEY WILL BE NEUTRAL GO BETWEENS </s>
<s> WE ARE OBSERVERS </s>
<s> THAT'S OUR JOB </s>
<s> WE OBSERVE </s>

<s> WITHIN MINUTES OF THEIR ARRIVAL A FAMILIAR CLASH WAS UNDERWAY WITH THE COMBATANTS OBLIVIOUS TO THE OBSERVERS HAVING A PRETTY HARD TIME OBSERVING ANYTHING THROUGH THE TEAR GAS </s>
<s> IN GAZA TODAY A BIG CROWD WAITED FOR THE PALESTINIAN POLICE FORCE TO COME MARCHING IN FROM EGYPT </s>
<s> BUT IT NEVER DID </s>

<s> SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE </s>
<s> IT WAS THE SAME STORY IN JERICHO </s>
<s> THEY HAD A PARADE BUT THE POLICE FORCE NEVER MADE IT IN FROM JORDAN </s>
