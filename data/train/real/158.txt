<s> NOW TO LAW AND ORDER </s>
<s> SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE DOMINATED BY THE REPUBLICANS </s>
<s> BUT THIS YEAR WITH THE ECONOMY SLUMPING AND CRIME TOUCHING THE LIVES OF MORE AND MORE AMERICANS THE LAW AND ORDER ISSUE IS UP FOR GRABS </s>
<s> IN LOS ANGELES C. N. N.'S DAN BLACKBURN </s>
<s> IN PARTS OF AMERICA VIOLENT CRIME HAS BECOME AN ASPECT OF DAILY LIFE AND VOTERS BOTH URBAN AND SUBURBAN WANT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO PAY MORE ATTENTION </s>
<s> STOP CUTTING TAXES AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THIS CRIME WE HAVE OUT HERE </s>
<s> IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S A HIGH PRIORITY BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY'VE ADDRESSED IT YET </s>
<s> IN RECENT DAYS PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEGUN HAMMERING AWAY AT THE ISSUE </s>
<s> LAST YEAR UNDER BILL CLINTON THE AVERAGE ARKANSAS CRIMINAL SERVED JUST ONE FIFTH OF HIS SENTENCE AND THEN IT'S BACK ON THE STREETS </s>
<s> APPARENTLY IN ARKANSAS YOU DO CRIME BUT NOT THE TIME </s>
<s> BILL CLINTON ALSO HAMMERS AT THE ISSUE </s>
<s> FOUR YEARS AGO THIS CRIME ISSUE WAS USED TO DIVIDE AMERICANS </s>
<s> I WANT TO USE IT TO UNITE AMERICANS </s>
<s> I WANT TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME AND GOOD FOR CIVIL RIGHTS </s>
<s> YOU CAN'T HAVE CIVIL JUSTICE WITHOUT ORDER AND SAFETY </s>
<s> CLINTON WAS REFERRING IN PART TO THIS NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL THE SO CALLED WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL USED TO LINK DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS TO BEING SOFT ON CRIME </s>
<s> IT'S AN ISSUE REPUBLICANS HAVE RUN ON SUCCESSFULLY SINCE THE SIXTIES WHEN URBAN RIOTING APPEARED TO PUT DEMOCRATS OFF BALANCE OVER LAW AND ORDER </s>
<s> THE DEMOCRATS GAVE THE CRIME ISSUE TO THE REPUBLICANS </s>
<s> THEY VERY WISELY TOOK IT AND RAN WITH IT AND THEY ASSOCIATED IT WITH RACE WHICH WAS A WIN WIN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THESE TWO DECADES </s>
<s> THIS YEAR HOWEVER POLLSTERS SAY CRIME CAN'T COMPETE POLITICALLY WITH THE ECONOMY </s>
<s> WHERE IT COMES INTO PLAY IS IF CLINTON STARTS TO TUMBLE IN A GENERAL WAY THEN PEOPLE RATIONALIZE WHY THEY'RE VOTING AGAINST HIM </s>
<s> AND AT THAT POINT CRIME AND ALL THE LITTLE ISSUES THEY'RE BRINGING UP NOW COME INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS </s>
<s> HOWEVER SINCE GEORGE BUSH TOOK OFFICE THE MURDER RATE HAS INCREASED BY THIRTEEN PERCENT </s>
<s> ROBBERY IS UP SEVENTEEN PERCENT AND RAPE UP ELEVEN PERCENT </s>
<s> AND POLICE OFFICERS TALK ESCALATING VIOLENCE </s>
<s> THIS DEPUTY DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IS BROTHER RECENTLY TRIED TO MAKE A TRAFFIC STOP </s>
<s> AND THE GANG MEMBERS DIDN'T STOP AND A PASSENGER HUNG OUT THE WINDOW WITH AN A. K. FORTY SEVEN AND SHOT UP HIS CAR </s>
<s> HE'S VERY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE </s>
<s> THE HEAD OF THE NATION'S LARGEST SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS THE ANSWER IS NOT TOUGH TALK BUT BETTER FEDERAL PERFORMANCE </s>
<s> WE'LL DO OUR JOB LOCALLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR DIFFICULTIES OUR PROBLEMS ARE EXACERBATED CONSIDERABLY NOT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT HELPING US DO OUR JOB THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOB </s>
<s> BLOCK AND OTHERS INSIST WHAT IS NEEDED IS NOT TOUGHER LAWS BUT BETTER MORE EFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS </s>
<s> AND THEY SAY THE CANDIDATES FROM PRESIDENT ON DOWN FAIL TO DEAL WITH THAT REALITY ALL TOGETHER </s>
