<s> THE PRESIDENT FACES A CONFRONTATION WITH CONGRESS WHEN HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON </s>
<s> THE HOUSE TODAY VOTED TO CUT FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE DEFENSE BUDGET </s>
<s> THAT SETS UP A POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT </s>
<s> NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH TO CUT BUT ABOUT WHAT TO CUT </s>
<s> THE HIGH TECH SEA WOLF SUBMARINE IS AT THE CENTER OF THE DISPUTE AS IRV CHAPMAN REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON </s>
<s> THE SEA WOLF A TWO BILLION DOLLAR NUCLEAR SUBMARINE DESIGNED TO STALK THE SOVIET WAR FLEET </s>
<s> THE SUB NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT ELECTRIC BOAT IN <UNK> CONNECTICUT WOULD BE THE LAST ONE IF PRESIDENT BUSH HAD HIS WAY </s>
<s> BUT THE HOUSE VOTED TO KEEP THESE WORKERS EMPLOYED BUILDING ONE MORE SEA WOLF A DAY AFTER THE SENATE VOTED FOR TWO MORE </s>
<s> CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAINTAIN A DEFENSE STRUCTURE THAT CAN PROTECT OUR INTERESTS AND ALMOST EVERYONE I TALKED TO BELIEVE THAT SUBMARINES OUGHT TO BE PART OF THAT MIX </s>
<s> PRESIDENT BUSH HAS ALREADY TOLD CONGRESS HE'LL VETO ADDITIONAL SPENDING ON THE SEA WOLF BUT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP PLUNGED AHEAD ANYWAY CASTING REPUBLICAN OBJECTIONS ASIDE </s>
<s> IF THE PEOPLE OUT IN THAT LISTENING LAND IN AMERICA THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS ANY OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO WIN THEY'RE MISTAKEN THE DICE ARE LOADED </s>
<s> THERE'S NO CHANCE </s>
<s> THE DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED THEIR BILLS IN BOTH HOUSES </s>
<s> THE SENATE PAYS FOR TWO EXTRA SEA WOLVES BY TAKING MONEY FROM THE B. TWO STEALTH BOMBER AND FROM STRATEGIC DEFENSE AGAINST INCOMING MISSILES STAR WARS </s>
<s> THEY OUGHT TO CUT S. D. I. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T PUT THE MONEY INTO THE SEA WOLF THEY SHOULD PUT IT INTO DOMESTIC PROGRAMS OR DEFICIT REDUCTION </s>
<s> SUPPORTERS OF THE SEA WOLF SAID IT WOULD COST AS MUCH TO PAY FOR SHUTTING DOWN CONSTRUCTION AS TO BUILD ANOTHER SUB </s>
<s> THE SEA WOLF IS THE LATEST CASE OF CONGRESS IGNORING IT'S OWN PROMISE TO INCREASE THE PEACE DIVIDEND BECAUSE BENEFITS TAKE TIME TO PRODUCE WHILE JOB LOSSES FROM DEFENSE CUTS ARE IMMEDIATE </s>
