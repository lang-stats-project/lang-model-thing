<s> THESE ARE THE FACES OF PIONEERS THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMEN TO MARCH OFF TO WAR </s>
<s> YOU GO BACK AND YOU THINK WELL THAT WAS A KIND OF A HARD THING THAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO BUT IT WAS REALLY WORTHWHILE ACCOMPLISHING IT </s>

<s> ALL THE MEN WENT AWAY THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD CATCH UP WITH IS GOING YOURSELF </s>
