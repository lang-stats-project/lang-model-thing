<s> AS WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE EXPRESSING REGRET ABOUT THE BLOODSHED IN MOSCOW BUT THEY ARE LINING UP BEHIND PRESIDENT YELTSIN SAYING HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACT </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S ROB REYNOLDS HAS MORE ON THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REACTION </s>
<s> AS THE FIGHTING IN MOSCOW RAGED EUROPEAN LEADERS ONCE AGAIN PLEDGED FULL SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN </s>
<s> I DON'T BELIEVE OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO THAT PRESIDENT YELTSIN HAD ANY CHOICE BUT TO ACT AS HE DID AND I VERY MUCH ADMIRE HIS RESTRAINT OVER RECENT MONTHS </s>
<s> THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS OUR TOTAL AND UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION THAT HE'S TAKEN </s>
<s> FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE TWELVE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY NATIONS ISSUED A STATEMENT BACKING YELTSIN IN HIS REFORMS </s>
<s> WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO WANT DEMOCRATIZATION AND REFORMS IN RUSSIA AS MR. YELTSIN AND HIS </s>
<s> IT IS EXTREMELY DEPLORABLE THAT HIS OPPONENTS HAVE SOUGHT VIOLENCE WHICH HAS LEFT PRESIDENT YELTSIN VERY LITTLE CHOICE I'M AFRAID </s>
<s> WE ARE ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE PATH OF REFORM </s>
<s> THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT </s>
<s> THE VIOLENCE IN MOSCOW IS MONITORED CLOSELY BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WHICH PROVIDES A LARGE PORTION OF RUSSIA'S FINANCIAL AID </s>
<s> VIOLENCE IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY IN A SITUATION WHICH HAS GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL TO BRING THINGS BACK INTO LINE </s>
<s> WHILE EUROPEAN SUPPORT FOR YELTSIN IS UNANIMOUS ANALYSTS SAY IT MAY BE A MISTAKE TO PUT ALL WESTERN EGGS IN YELTSIN'S BASKET </s>
<s> REMEMBER WE WENT OVERBOARD ON GORBACHEV HIS PREDECESSOR AND WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN HE WAS EDGED OUT </s>
<s> I THINK IF YELTSIN IS EDGED OUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE REALLY PREPARED FOR THAT </s>
<s> I HOPE HOWEVER THAT DESPITE ALL THIS SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GIVING YELTSIN SOMEBODY'S MAKING CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR SOME KIND OF ALTERNATIVE </s>
<s> YELTSIN'S APPARENT VICTORY IN THE LATEST CRISIS BROUGHT RELIEF TO EUROPEAN LEADERS BUT NONE COULD BE CONFIDENT THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE MORE INSTABILITY IN RUSSIA'S FUTURE </s>
