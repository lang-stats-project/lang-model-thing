<s> LINDA PATTILLO A. B. C. NEWS </s>
<s> THE F. B. I. HAS CERTAINLY NOT HEARD THE LAST OF THIS </s>
<s> ALREADY THERE ARE WASHINGTON POLITICIANS CALLING FOR A FULL INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> FROM THE VERY OUTSET FIFTY ONE DAYS AGO THERE HAS BEEN SECOND GUESSING </s>
<s> HERE'S OUR LAW CORRESPONDENT TIM O'BRIEN </s>
<s> THE PROBLEMS BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY </s>
<s> FOUR AGENTS OF THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS WERE SHOT TO DEATH WHEN THEY TRIED TO SERVE A SEARCH WARRANT FOR ILLEGAL WEAPONS </s>
<s> CULT LEADERS APPARENTLY KNEW THEY WERE COMING AND THE AGENTS WERE BADLY OUTGUNNED </s>
<s> I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY ANYTHING THEY DID WRONG </s>
<s> LIKE I SAID THEY HAD BIGGER GUNS THAN WE DID </s>
<s> AS THE STANDOFF CONTINUED NOTHING THE F. B. I. DID SEEMED TO WORK INCLUDING BOMBARDING THE COMPOUND WITH SOUND EVERYTHING FROM COWS TO TIBETAN CHANTS </s>
<s> THROUGHOUT THE FIFTY ONE DAY SIEGE THE F. B. I. SEEMED AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER </s>
<s> WE'RE VERY CONCERNED AS PART OF KORESH'S GRAND SCHEME THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS PEOPLE DIE WHICH WOULD BE JUSTIFICATION FOR HIS PRONOUNCEMENTS AND BE A FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES </s>
<s> HE HAS MORE OF A CHARLES MANSON MENTALITY YOU KNOW AND I DO SEE HIM AS EVENTUALLY BECOMING VERY VIOLENT IF HE'S PUSHED IN A CORNER </s>
<s> I APPROVED THE PLAN AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR IT </s>
<s> I ADVISED THE PRESIDENT BUT I DID NOT ADVISE HIM AS TO THE DETAILS </s>
<s> ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO LATE THIS AFTERNOON DEFENDED THE DECISION EVEN THOUGH IT ENDED IN DISASTER </s>
<s> I THINK THE F. B. I. IN THIS SITUATION HAS SHOWN REMARKABLE RESTRAINT </s>
<s> I THINK THEY DID NOT LOSE THEIR PATIENCE </s>
<s> I THINK THEY CAREFULLY THOUGHT THIS OUT DEVELOPED IT AS PART OF A COHERENT AND CONTINUING PLAN </s>
<s> BUT THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS TONIGHT ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY AUTHORITIES CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF MASS SUICIDE PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE MASS SUICIDES FIFTEEN YEARS AGO OF NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN MEMBERS OF ANOTHER RELIGIOUS CULT IN JONESTOWN <UNK> </s>
<s> SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES ARE CONSIDERING HOLDING HEARINGS ON HOW THE STANDOFF WAS HANDLED WHETHER ADDITIONAL STEPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MINIMIZE THE LOSS OF LIFE WITH AT LEAST RANKING CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTING THE F. B. I. JUST RAN OUT OF PATIENCE </s>
<s> TIM O'BRIEN A. B. C. NEWS WASHINGTON </s>
<s> AS WE SAID A MOMENT AGO THE F. B. I. HAS NOT HEARD THE END OF THIS NOR SURELY HAS THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE </s>
<s> LET'S GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE NOW AND TALK TO OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT BRIT HUME </s>
<s> SEEN FROM THERE WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THEM THINK THEY HAD TO GO NOW AND THAT THE F. B. I. HAD TO MAKE THESE MOVES </s>
<s> PETER YESTERDAY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TELEPHONED THE PRESIDENT HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND MADE THE CASE TO HIM FOR THIS OPERATION BASICALLY CITING THREE CONCERNS </s>
<s> ONE IS THE FEELING FROM THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND DOWN THERE THAT NEGOTIATIONS WERE NOT GOING TO WORK AND THAT THEY HAD RUN THEIR COURSE SECOND THE DANGER OF WHAT THEY FEARED WAS CONTINUING SEXUAL AND OTHER PHYSICAL ABUSE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME KIND OF A MASS SUICIDE AND FINALLY THE FEELING THAT THE TEAM OF AGENTS AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND WHO WERE MANNING THE PERIMETER SO CALLED DOWN THERE WERE AT THE END OF THEIR ROPE IN THE SENSE OF BEING VERY VERY TIRED AND BECAUSE OF SPECIAL TRAINING NOT EASILY REPLACEABLE </s>
<s> AND THEREFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TOLD THE PRESIDENT IT WAS BUILD BY EVERYONE THAT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE AND THE PRESIDENT AS JANET RENO LATER REPORTED SAID OKAY </s>
<s> BRIT IN PURELY POLITICAL TERMS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE WAS AVOIDING ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS </s>
<s> WELL THE WORD HERE HAS BEEN ALL ALONG ABOUT THIS WHOLE OPERATION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD CEDED OPERATIONAL CONTROL TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT </s>
<s> AND AGAIN TODAY THE PRESIDENT WAS PORTRAYED AS BASICALLY <UNK> IN THE DECISION RATHER THAN HAVING IT BE HIS PLAN AND WITH HIM DIRECTLY CALLING THE SHOTS </s>
<s> HOWEVER ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT DID TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATION HAVE BEEN ANSWERED YES IT IS HIS ADMINISTRATION HE IS THE PRESIDENT HE IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE </s>
<s> OKAY </s>
<s> BRIT HUME THANKS VERY MUCH AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS EVENING </s>
