<s> HOWEVER THEY SAY THE <UNK> WARHEAD DID NOT ARM ITSELF AND THEY SAY THE DAMAGED WAS CAUSED BY WHAT'S CALLED KINETIC IMPACT </s>

<s> THEY WERE HIT AND THEY SAY U. S. PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THAT NOW THE AIR DEFENSE IN SOUTHERN IRAQ IS OUT OF COMMISSION </s>
<s> HOWEVER THE S. A. THREE MOBILE MISSILES THAT WERE PART OF THE TARGET LIST WERE NOT HIT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE MOVE AT THE TIME THE U. S. PLANNED TO HIT THEM </s>

<s> THE DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO GO AFTER THOSE MISSILES SINCE THEY WERE MOVING THEREFORE MAKING THEM HARDER TARGETS AND ALSO MEANING THEY WERE NOT OPERATIONAL AT THE TIME </s>
