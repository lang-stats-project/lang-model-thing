<s> HOWDY NEAL </s>
<s> YOU ALWAYS THINK JAZZ MOVIES ARE GOING TO BE TERRIFIC THEY'RE ABOUT A UNIQUE KIND OF LIFE BUT DOES THIS ONE FALL INTO THOSE KIND OF YOU KNOW SMOKY CAFE CLICHES THAT HAPPEN SO OFTEN </s>
<s> NO IT SORT OF DOESN'T BECAUSE IT REALLY DEALS WITH THE WAY THESE TWO GUYS WHO SORT OF LIVE THIS MARGINAL LIFE ARE TRYING TO SORT OF GRAB ALL THEY CAN OUT OF IT </s>
<s> AND YOU KNOW JEFF <UNK> MARRIED TO THE WONDERFUL KATHY BAKER IN THIS MOVIE AND SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T QUITE GET HOME ON TIME FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND FORREST WHITAKER JUST TRIES TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE INSTRUMENT </s>
<s> WHAT YOU REALLY GET OUT OF THIS IS A YOU KNOW THESE GUYS REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER AND WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S KIND OF <UNK> ANECDOTAL </s>
<s> FORREST WHITAKER OF COURSE PLAYED A JAZZ MUSICIAN CHARLIE PARKER IN BIRD THE CLINT EASTWOOD MOVIE </s>
<s> JEFF GOLDBLUM MAY BE BEST REMEMBERED AS THE FLY </s>
<s> THEY PLAY TWO MUSICIANS ONE BLACK ONE WHITE </s>
<s> IS THIS KIND OF AN I DON'T KNOW A <UNK> BUDDY MOVIE </s>

<s> I THINK GOLDBLUM WAS IN THAT WHAT WAS IT JURASSIC SOMETHING OR ANOTHER LAST SUMMER </s>
<s> I THINK THAT MADE SOME MONEY YEAH </s>
<s> YEAH ITS UNIMPORTANT </s>
<s> I'M GLAD HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT MAY ACTUALLY MAKE A LOT OF DOUGH FOR HIM HERE ON <UNK> </s>
<s> WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCES THAT THE WRITER SLASH DIRECTOR MICHAEL ELIAS GETS OUT OF THE ACTORS JEFF GOLDBLUM TENDS TO DO SOMETHING THAT MOST ACTORS CAN'T </s>
<s> HE'S BETTER WITH A PAUSE THAN MOST ACTORS ARE WITH ACTUAL DIALOGUE </s>
<s> BUT WHAT HE DOES HERE IS GIVEN AN UNAFFECTED NATURAL AND I THINK REAL ADULT MOVIE STAR PERFORMANCE HERE </s>
<s> VIDEO PICK THIS WEEK ELVIS </s>

<s> AND AGAIN IT'S ABOUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN BETWEEN TWO MEN THAT'S SORT OF SKEWED </s>
<s> AND THE WAY BOTH THESE MOVIES FEEL EUROPEAN BECAUSE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR DEBT TO JOY LA GEM AND YOU CAN SORT OF FEEL WHATEVER IT IS THESE WOMEN DO THAT THEY'RE ACCEPTED AND NOT ACCEPTED AND THERE'S A KIND OF REAL <UNK> IN BOTH I THINK THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS AND IN <UNK> LIFE ABOUT GUYS WHO DON'T WANT TO QUITE COME OUT OF THE TREE HOUSE YET EVEN THOUGH ITS BEEN TIME FOR THEM TO DO SO A LONG TIME AGO </s>
