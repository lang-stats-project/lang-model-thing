<s> WHAT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR MANY AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW THE U. S. MILITARY WITH ALL ITS ADVANCED WEAPONRY AND SEEMINGLY HIGHLY TRAINED SOLDIERS CAN BE DENIED VICTORY BY WHAT ON THE SURFACE LOOKS LIKE A RAG TAG ARMY </s>
<s> AS OUR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT BOB ZELNICK REPORTS IT IS COMPLICATED </s>
<s> THE TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS LOADED FOR THE FLIGHT TO SOMALIA ARE MEANT TO COME QUICKLY TO THE RESCUE OF ANY TROOPS UNDER ATTACK IN ANY PART OF MOGADISHU DAY OR NIGHT </s>
<s> WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INCREASE THE FORCE IN ANY LARGE WAY AT THIS POINT </s>
<s> WE'RE JUST RESPONDING TO AN IMMEDIATE NEED </s>

<s> THE ARMORED EQUIPMENT IS NECESSARY PARTLY BECAUSE HELICOPTERS ARE PROVING EASY TARGETS FOR GUERRILLAS WHO ARE NOW USING CONVERTED ARTILLERY GUNS AND ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADES AGAINST THEM </s>
<s> PRIVATELY U. S. OFFICIALS PAINT AN INCREASINGLY BLEAK PICTURE OF SECURITY IN SOUTH MOGADISHU </s>
<s> MUCH OF THE AREA IS EITHER CONTROLLED BY AIDID'S GUNMEN OR BITTERLY CONTESTED </s>
<s> THEY SAY THAT AIDID ALSO CONTROLS A LARGE TRIANGULAR AREA OF CENTRAL SOMALIA FROM WHERE HE IS ABLE TO SECURE STEADY REINFORCEMENTS OF TROOPS AND WEAPONS </s>
<s> INCREASINGLY MILITARY LEADERS SAY THAT RESTORING SECURITY IN MOGADISHU COULD REQUIRE A COMMITMENT FAR BEYOND WHAT PUBLIC OPINION WOULD SUPPORT </s>
