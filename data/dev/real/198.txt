<s> GOOD EVENING FROM WASHINGTON </s>
<s> MORE D. N. A. TESTIMONY ONE LESS JUROR IS OUR SUMMATION OF THIS WEEK'S EVENTS IN THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL </s>
<s> HERE TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE EVENTS SCIENTIFIC AND SURPRISING ARE DOCTOR LARRY <UNK> PROFESSOR OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AT THE JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADAM KURLAND HE IS FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR MARION BARRY NOW AT THE HOWARD UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL AND FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR JOSEPH DIGENOVA NOW IN THE PRIVATE PRACTICE OF LAW </s>
<s> WE THANK THEM ALL FOR COMING </s>
<s> WERE YOU SURPRISED JOE WE'LL START WITH YOU THAT THE JUDGE DID NOT RULE IN THE DEFENSE'S FAVOR AND DID NOT ADMIT THE SIMPSON STATEMENT </s>
<s> NO I WAS NOT SURPRISED AT ALL BECAUSE THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR THAT THAT WAS NOT A STATEMENT </s>
<s> AND ALSO JOHNNIE COCHRAN HAD MENTIONED THIS IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT </s>
<s> I WENT BACK AND READ HIS OPENING STATEMENT TODAY AND HE CLEARLY SAYS MR. SIMPSON WAS ON A PLANE TO CHICAGO </s>
<s> THIS WITNESS ACTUALLY SAID LESS THAN WHAT JOHNNIE COCHRAN SAID IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT </s>
<s> SO I THINK THE DEFENSE WAS A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS </s>
<s> WHY THEN LARRY DID THE JUDGE GET SO UPSET WHEN HE HEARD IT </s>
<s> HE GAVE YOU THE INDICATION HE WAS GOING TO RULE IN THEIR FAVOR HE ACTED SO UPSET </s>
<s> I THINK THAT HE HE WAS IT WAS A SURPRISE </s>
<s> THE I EXPECTED THE JUDGE TO ACTUALLY RULE AGAINST ADMITTING THAT STATEMENT </s>
<s> YOU DID </s>
<s> I DID </s>
<s> EVEN THOUGH HE ACTED UPSET AND ANGERED WHEN HE HEARD IT </s>
<s> YES </s>
<s> SO THAT DIDN'T LEAD YOU TO THINK ONE WAY WOULD GO THE OTHER </s>
<s> THAT'S RIGHT </s>
