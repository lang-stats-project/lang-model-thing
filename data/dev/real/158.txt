<s> MARCIA CLARK COMPLAINING ABOUT BARRY SCHECK'S REFERENCE TO O. J. SIMPSON'S STATEMENT TO POLICE </s>
<s> THE COURT KNEW THAT MR. SCHECK WAS GOING TO TRY AND GET THAT IN FRONT OF THE JURY </s>
<s> I'M SURE THAT YOU DID </s>

<s> AND TO DELIBERATELY ASK SUCH IMPROPER QUESTIONS SUCH INFLAMMATORY QUESTIONS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO THWART JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIGHTLY </s>
<s> AND WE ARE ASKING THE COURT TO IMPOSE A SANCTION AND WE'RE GOING TO DRAFT A PROPOSAL FOR THAT SANCTION </s>
<s> I'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER FURTHER WITH COUNSEL CONCERNING THAT </s>
