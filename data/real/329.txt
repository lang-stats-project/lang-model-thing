<s> PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS THE LATEST NUMBERS ARE FURTHER PROOF THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS HIS PLAN FOR REDUCING THE DEFICIT </s>
<s> HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE AND HIS STAFF NEED TO REFOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT </s>
<s> AS THE PRESIDENT PUT IT TO GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT </s>
<s> HERE'S A. B. C.'S BRIT HUME </s>
<s> IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED HE'S CONTEMPLATING SOME CHANGES IN THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF AS HE PREPARES A MAJOR PUSH TO GET HIS ECONOMIC PROGRAM THROUGH CONGRESS </s>
<s> HE CONCEDED SOME OF THAT LASER FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY HE PROMISED HAS BEEN LOST </s>
<s> ONE THING THAT YOU RISK WHEN YOU TRY TO GET A LOT OF THINGS GOING IN A HURRY IS THAT YOU WIND UP HAVING PEOPLE WORK VERY VERY HARD BUT MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF FOCUS </s>
<s> AND I THINK WE SHOULD BRING IT TIGHTEN THE FOCUS A LITTLE BIT </s>
<s> I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO </s>
<s> ON CAPITOL HILL THERE WERE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THE CLINTON PROGRAM'S MOMENTUM WHICH ONCE SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE HAS FADED JUST AS THE LARGE TAX INCREASES HE'S PROPOSED ARE BEING TAKEN UP </s>
<s> I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROVISIONS IN THIS TAX BILL WE WOULD GET A MAJORITY FOR </s>
<s> BUT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BY JUNE EIGHTEENTH </s>
<s> IF MOYNIHAN IS WORRIED THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE TOO BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ON HIS COMMITTEE HAVE ONLY AN ELEVEN TO NINE MAJORITY MEANING ONE SWITCHED VOTE COULD BLOCK THE PROGRAM </s>
<s> THE ASSESSMENT WAS A BIT MORE POSITIVE ON THE HOUSE SIDE </s>
<s> BUT EVEN THERE THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WAS MAKING NO PROMISES </s>
<s> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THAT THE TASK BEFORE US IS ENORMOUS </s>
<s> BUT I'M FIRMLY COMMITTED TO HELPING PRESIDENT CLINTON ACHIEVE HIS BASIC PLAN AND REACH HIS DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGETS </s>
<s> REPUBLICANS WERE MAKING CLEAR TODAY THEY WILL RESIST </s>
<s> I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE DEFICIT IS HIGH BECAUSE WE SPEND TOO MUCH NOT BECAUSE WE TAX THE AMERICAN WORKERS TOO LITTLE </s>
<s> THE REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH MILEAGE OUT OF THAT ISSUE SINCE GEORGE BUSH BROKE HIS NO NEW TAXES PROMISES THREE YEARS AGO </s>
<s> BUT NOW WITH MR. CLINTON HAVING PROPOSED EVEN BIGGER NEW TAXES THE REPUBLICANS HOPE AT LEAST THEY'VE GO THE TAX ISSUE BACK </s>
