<s> PRESIDENT CLINTON IS MAKING A FINAL PITCH TO SETTLE THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STRIKE </s>
<s> HE SENT LEGISLATION TO CAPITOL HILL REQUIRING BINDING ARBITRATION </s>
<s> HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH SAID HE THINKS IT'S A VERY BAD IDEA TO HAVE CONGRESS START SETTLING LABOR DISPUTES </s>
<s> BUT THERE IS SOME SENTIMENT FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION </s>
<s> IF THIS CONTINUES THERE MAY BE A CONGRESSIONAL SOLUTION BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE A FEW OWNERS WHO WANT TO BREAK THE PLAYERS' UNION AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE VOTING SITUATION </s>
<s> SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT CLINTON HAVE ASKED BASEBALL FANS TO FLOOD CAPITOL HILL WITH PHONE CALLS </s>
<s> SO FAR MOST CALLS TO REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED IN BASEBALL </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S JEFF FLOCK HAS FOUND A SIMILAR REACTION FROM BASEBALL FANS IN THE MIDWEST </s>
<s> SO THIS AUGUST BODY IS GOING TO SOLVE THE BASEBALL STRIKE </s>
<s> CONGRESS CAN'T DO IT </s>
<s> THEY HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE RIPPING THE PEOPLE OFF </s>
<s> SO THE NATIONAL LEADER IS GOING TO SAVE THE NATIONAL PASTIME </s>
<s> HE SHOULDN'T HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT </s>
<s> IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS </s>
<s> LESS THAN AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE FROM <UNK> </s>
<s> I FEEL LIKE THE PRESIDENT HAVE ENOUGH ON HIS HANDS AT THE PRESENT TIME TO NOT EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE BASEBALL STRIKE </s>
<s> HEARD ON THE STREET IN ATLANTA </s>
<s> HEARD ON THE AIR IN DETROIT </s>
<s> ANYTIME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BIG BROTHER TO BAIL YOU OUT OF ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM </s>
<s> ON LARRY <UNK> AND BUTCH <UNK> CALL IN SHOW THE SENTIMENT IS LEAVE BAD ENOUGH ALONE </s>
<s> I DON'T THINK IT'S A NATIONAL EMERGENCY </s>
<s> I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE BASEBALL STRIKE </s>
<s> THEN AGAIN TELL THAT TO THE GUY AT THE NEAR EMPTY <UNK> NEAR WRIGLEY FIELD IN CHICAGO WHERE BUSINESS IS OFF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SINCE THE STRIKE </s>
<s> BRING ON CONGRESS HE SAYS </s>
<s> I THINK THAT THEY MIGHT JUST GIVE SOME KIND OF ADVICE AND KIND OF ADVISE BOTH SIDES OF THE BASEBALL INDUSTRY AND BASICALLY YOU KNOW HELP THEM MAKE A DECISION </s>
<s> MOST ARE FOR THAT </s>
<s> I THINK BILL CLINTON WANTS TO PLAY CATCHER FOR THE METS IS WHAT I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S DOING IT </s>
<s> IN LOS ANGELES THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MIND </s>
<s> BUT AT LEAST ONE MAN HAD THE RIGHT IDEA </s>
<s> I THINK EVERYBODY'S AT FAULT </s>
<s> THEY SHOULD SETTLE IT GET IT TOGETHER PLAY BASEBALL </s>
<s> PLAY BALL </s>
<s> OH TO HEAR THAT SOUND </s>
