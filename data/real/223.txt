<s> REFORMING THE COUNTRY'S WELFARE SYSTEM IS ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION </s>
<s> LIKE HEALTH CARE REFORM CALLS FOR WELFARE REFORM ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY THE NEED TO SAVE MONEY AND BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET </s>

<s> MAINE PUBLIC RADIO'S ANDREA <UNK> REPORTS </s>

<s> BUT THE STATE OF MAINE FACES A ONE BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IN ITS THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND GOVERNOR JOHN <UNK> SAYS MAINE MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS </s>
<s> OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE MAINE A MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO CREATE JOBS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE MAKING THESE DIFFICULT SPENDING DECISIONS IS THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THE SPENDING UNDER CONTROL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RAISE TAXES WHICH IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CREATING JOBS </s>
