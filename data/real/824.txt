<s> NOW IN THIS STUDY INDICATES A POPULAR FERTILITY DRUG CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS C. N. N.'S ANDREW HOLTZ HAS DETAILS </s>
<s> DOCTOR ANA MURPHY IS EXAMINING DANA BARRY USING ULTRASOUND </s>
<s> HERE'S YOUR UTERUS RIGHT THERE O. K. AND YOU CAN SEE THE <UNK> STRIPE </s>
<s> SHE IS LOOKING FOR SIGNS THAT HE DRUG <UNK> IS PROMPTING OVULATION IN ORDER TO INCREASE DANA BARRY'S CHANCES OF BECOMING PREGNANT </s>
<s> BUT <UNK> ALSO KNOW AS <UNK> OR <UNK> MAY ALSO INCREASE RISKS OF DISEASE </s>
<s> ACCORDING TO A STUDY THAT CONCLUDES INFERTILE WOMEN HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NORMAL RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS </s>
<s> INCLUDING BOTH CANCERS AND BENIGN GROWTHS </s>
<s> WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE INCREASED RISKS OF OVARIAN TUMORS WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE <UNK> OF WOMEN WHO HAD TAKEN THE DRUG <UNK> AND WHO HAD TAKEN IT FOR A YEAR OR MORE </s>
<s> YET EVEN IN THIS GROUP OF WOMEN OVARIAN TUMORS ARE UNCOMMON </s>
<s> THE RESEARCHERS CALCULATE THAT DURING A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING TREATMENT <UNK> RAISES THE RISK OF AN OVARIAN TUMOR FROM ABOUT ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED TO ABOUT ONE IN FIFTY </s>
<s> FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO DEVELOP OVARIAN TUMORS A NUMBER OF THESE ARE NOT OF THE MOST SERIOUS FORM AND COULD BE CURED </s>

<s> SO YES I THINK THIS TO A LARGE EXTENT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF HOW WE THINK OF <UNK> AS A DRUG </s>
<s> YET <UNK> WHICH IS USED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES A YEAR IN THE U. S. WILL LIKELY REMAIN POPULAR </s>
<s> THE ALTERNATIVES TO <UNK> ARE INJECTED DRUGS RATHER THAN PILLS </s>
<s> THEY REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE MONITORING AND CARE AND THEY COST MORE </s>
<s> AND SWITCHING TREATMENTS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ELIMINATE THE RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS </s>
<s> IT'S A RISK DANA BARRY IS WILLING TO ACCEPT </s>
<s> I WILL STILL TAKE IT BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS I WON'T <UNK> AND WITHOUT <UNK> I WOULD NOT HAVE A BABY SO YOU KNOW THERE IS NOT VERY MANY CHOICES HERE </s>
