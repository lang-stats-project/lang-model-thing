<s> ANIMALS DO THE DARNEDEST THINGS AND BEARS ARE NO EXCEPTION </s>
<s> THINGS WERE UP IN THE AIR IN VIRGINIA BEACH VIRGINIA THIS WEEK WHEN RESIDENTS DISCOVERED THIS BEAR UP A TREE </s>
<s> I MEAN IT WAS REALLY WEIRD TO SEE IT IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA LIKE THAT </s>
<s> THE BEAR SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING HIS <UNK> PERCH BUT OFFICERS WANTED HIM DOWN </s>
<s> SO THEY FIRED A <UNK> DART AND THE <UNK> BEAR FELL TO THE EARTH </s>
<s> WILDLIFE EXPERTS THEORIZE IT CAME FROM A NEARBY SWAMP SO THEY TOOK HIM BACK HOME AFTER AN EXAMINATION COULD BEAR OUT </s>
<s> THE SLEEPY INTRUDER WAS O. K. </s>
<s> PEOPLE CAN DROP PRECIPITOUSLY TOO LIKE WHEN THEY'RE ON A RIP ROARING WATER SLIDE </s>
<s> NOW THERE'S A NEW DESIGN THAT TURNS CONVENTION UPSIDE DOWN A WATER SLIDE THAT SENDS PEOPLE UPHILL </s>
<s> THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE THE WET AND WILD DROP OF A WATER SLIDE AND THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE THIS SLIDE </s>
<s> IT CAN ALSO BLAST RIDERS UPHILL </s>

<s> ACTUALLY <UNK> HAS MADE A RIDE THAT'S SIMILAR TO THE MASTER <UNK> </s>
<s> THE FLOW RIDER SIMULATES SURFING WITH SHEETS OF WATER SENT OVER A SPECIALLY SHAPED HILL </s>
<s> <UNK> HAS SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING HIS RIDES </s>
<s> BESIDES DESIGNING THEM HE ALSO SERVED AS TEST PILOT WHICH DURING THE EARLY DAYS CALLED FOR PROTECTIVE GEAR </s>
<s> WHILE THE IDEA MAY SEEM SIMPLE MAKING THE MASTER <UNK> WORK TOOK SOME CAREFUL ENGINEERING </s>
<s> WE'RE BRINGING THE WATER UPHILL </s>
<s> ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO VENT THAT WATER BECAUSE AS THE WATER SLOWS DOWN IT WANTS TO PUDDLE UP </s>
<s> AND THAT'S WHAT TOOK US SO LONG TO PERFECT </s>
