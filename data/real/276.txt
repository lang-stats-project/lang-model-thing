<s> FROM THE WORLD BENEATH THE SEA HUMANS CONSTANTLY ARE DISCOVERING WAYS TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES </s>
<s> ONE OF THE LATEST COULD LEAD TO SOME EARTH FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY </s>
<s> C. N. N. SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT MILES O'BRIEN HAS MORE ON THIS PEARL OF A MATERIAL </s>
<s> PART OF THIS <UNK> EXTRACTED FROM OYSTER SHELLS IS A PROTEIN CALLED <UNK> </s>
<s> IT HELPS <UNK> SURVIVE BY CONTROLLING HOW THEIR SHELLS GROW AND NOW A SYNTHETIC VERSION OF THE SAME PROTEIN MAY HELP PEOPLE PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT </s>
<s> SCIENTISTS AT <UNK> UNIVERSITY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE THE <UNK> PROTEIN IN THE LABORATORY </s>
<s> THEY'RE HOPING IT MAY SOON BE USED IN PRODUCTS RANGING FROM <UNK> TO DISPOSABLE DIAPERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SOME OF THE NON <UNK> CHEMICALS NOW IN USE </s>
<s> AND THEY ARE USED IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES </s>
<s> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF THESE BEING USED </s>
<s> THE CHEMICALS CALLED <UNK> ARE USED TO PREVENT PARTICLES IN WATER FROM CLUMPING TOGETHER </s>
<s> IN THE CASE OF <UNK> THEY KEEP DIRT FROM STICKING TOGETHER IN THE WASH WATER AND GETTING BACK ONTO CLEAN CLOTHES OR DISHES </s>
<s> THEY'RE ALSO USED IN BOILERS AND COOLING TOWERS TO KEEP MINERAL SCALE FROM BUILDING UP AND BLOCKING PIPES AND THEY'RE USED IN THE SUPER <UNK> MATERIALS THAT SOAK UP LIQUID IN DISPOSABLE DIAPERS </s>

<s> BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT HELPS CONTROL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHELL HE FIGURED IT MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MINERAL BUILD UP IN OTHER SITUATIONS </s>

<s> THE QUESTION WAS WHERE TO GET ENOUGH OF THE PROTEIN TO EXPERIMENT WITH </s>
<s> WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT ONE COULDN'T USE EITHER NATURAL SYSTEMS TO MAKE ENOUGH PROTEIN OR WE COULDN'T EXTRACT ENOUGH PROTEIN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE FROM <UNK> OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE KIND OF APPLICATIONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT </s>
<s> SO THEY HAD TO LEARN EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN THE PROTEIN AND THEN COME UP WITH A WAY TO MAKE IT IN THE LAB </s>
<s> WHEELER SAYS THE PROCESS COULD EASILY BE SCALED UP FOR USE IN INDUSTRY </s>
<s> A FORM OF THE CHEMICAL THAT WOULD WORK IN DETERGENTS IS ALMOST READY FOR MARKET </s>
<s> WE'RE TALKING REALLY ABOUT ONLY MONTHS TO LESS THAN A YEAR BEFORE THAT COULD HAPPEN </s>

<s> DEVELOPING A FORM OF <UNK> FOR USE IN DISPOSABLE DIAPERS IS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD BUT IT HOLDS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAKING TONS OF LANDFILL GARBAGE MORE <UNK> </s>
