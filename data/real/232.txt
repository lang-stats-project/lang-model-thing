<s> WELL PAYING THE COST OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION HAS NEVER BEEN EASY AND NOW EVEN A GOVERNMENT COMMISSION SAYS THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM NEEDS FIXING </s>
<s> C. N. N.'S PAUL VERCAMMEN REPORTS </s>
<s> THE HIGH COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY STUDENT OR PARENT FEEL HARD HIT </s>
<s> THERE MUST BE LIKE A BETTER WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE </s>
<s> AND THE RED TAPE OF APPLYING FOR MULTIPLE LOANS AND GRANTS COULD GIVE YOU WRITER'S <UNK> </s>
<s> PEOPLE BEGIN TO THINK IT'S LIKE DOING INCOME TAXES YOU KNOW </s>
<s> I'VE GOT TO GO HIRE SOME PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR ME </s>
<s> THE DREAM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS A NIGHTMARE FOR MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES </s>
<s> ON WEDNESDAY AFTER TWO YEARS OF STUDY A BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IT HOPES WILL HELP </s>
<s> THE COMMISSION WANTS ALL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR AN AID PACKAGE UP TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MORE GRANTS TO POORER STUDENTS MORE LOANS FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY </s>
<s> TO MAKE LOAN REPAYMENT LESS BURDENSOME THE OPTION OF PAYING BACK WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE </s>
<s> AND TO ALLOW PARENTS TO DIG DEEPER FOR FUNDS THE COMMISSION WANTS TAX BREAKS FOR COLLEGE RELATED I. R. A. WITHDRAWALS AND <UNK> SAVINGS BONDS </s>
<s> WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF AMERICA CANNOT GET INTO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW UNLESS THEY ARE TERRIBLY POOR OR TERRIBLY RICH </s>
<s> MY GRANDPARENTS THEIR WAY OF PASSING THEIR INHERITANCE ON TO ME IS TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION </s>
<s> AND SO OUR FAMILY EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT SO MY GRANDPARENTS PAY FOR ME </s>
<s> BUT RIGHT NOW SOME SAY GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS TERRIBLY POOR AND THEY WONDER WHERE IT WILL DIG UP SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THE PLAN </s>
<s> WE CAN AFFORD TO DO SOME OF IT </s>
<s> I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANYBODY THE IMPRESSION WE CAN AFFORD TO DO ALL OF IT </s>
<s> SO LIKE MANY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS STRUGGLING ON A TIGHT BUDGET CONGRESS MAY HAVE TO COMPROMISE ITS AMBITIOUS EDUCATION PLAN </s>
