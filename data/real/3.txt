<s> FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE VERDICT A JUROR IN THE LOS ANGELES BEATING TRIAL HAS SPOKEN OUT </s>
<s> INTERVIEWED <UNK> ON C. N. N. YESTERDAY SHE SAID SHE DID NOT REGRET THE PANEL'S DECISION </s>
<s> SHE SAID RACISM WAS NEVER AN ISSUE IN THE TRIAL OR IN THE JURY'S DELIBERATIONS </s>
<s> AND SHE EXPLAINED HOW THE JURY BELIEVED RODNEY KING HAD CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTER HE WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE </s>
<s> HE HAD TWO COMPANIONS IN THE CAR WITH HIM </s>
<s> AND WHEN HE FINALLY DID STOP AFTER A LONG PURSUIT THE OTHER TWO <UNK> GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND WERE SEARCHED YOU KNOW AND HANDCUFFED AND PUT INTO VEHICLES TO BE TAKEN FOR <UNK> WHILE RODNEY KING TENDED TO FROLIC AROUND AND MAKE JOKES APPARENTLY WITH EVERYTHING AND BE VERY COMBATIVE </s>
<s> AND I FEEL THAT THE POLICE DID ONLY WHAT THEY HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO GET HIM UNDER CONTROL </s>
<s> WELL THE U. S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T YET CONVINCED OF THAT AND MAY TAKE UP THE RODNEY KING CASE WHERE THE JURY LEFT OFF </s>
<s> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE FOUR L. A. POLICE OFFICERS DENIED KING HIS CIVIL RIGHTS BY USING EXCESSIVE FORCE </s>
<s> WE GET MORE FROM C. N. N.'S ANTHONY COLLINGS </s>
<s> THE POLICE BEATING OF RODNEY KING COULD LEAD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF IT </s>
<s> THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SPEED UP AN INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WHETHER THERE WAS INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EXCESSIVE FORCE TO CON WHICH MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS </s>
<s> FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS PROVIDE UP TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON AND A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE FOR CONSPIRACY TO DEPRIVE A PERSON OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS </s>
<s> ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAYNE BUDD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S NUMBER THREE OFFICIAL HEADS THE NEW INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> WITH REGARD TO THE RODNEY KING MATTER THE JURY VERDICT YESTERDAY IS NOT THE LAST STEP </s>
<s> BUDD AND A TEAM OF PROSECUTORS WILL REVIEW THE STATE TRIAL BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INDICT THE POLICE ON FEDERAL CHARGES </s>
<s> THE F. B. I. WILL INVESTIGATE AGAIN AS IT DID BEFORE IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE STATE PROSECUTION </s>
<s> WE HAD CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED OUR PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> AT THAT POINT IT WAS STOPPED AND SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF <UNK> CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION WE WILL BEGIN AGAIN </s>
<s> AMONG PRECEDENTS FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PAST WAS THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR MURDER OF THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS IN MISSISSIPPI </s>
<s> A SHERIFF AND A DEPUTY WERE CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS </s>
<s> THE INCIDENT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE FILM MISSISSIPPI BURNING </s>
<s> AMONG MORE RECENT CASE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR FOUR HOUSING AUTHORITY POLICE WERE INDICTED ON FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CONSPIRACY CHARGES </s>
<s> SINCE OCTOBER EIGHTY EIGHTH WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR POLICE BRUTALITY </s>
<s> THAT INCLUDES OFFICERS IN I BELIEVE TWENTY THREE JURISDICTIONS </s>
<s> OUR CONVICTION RATE IS RUNNING APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT </s>
<s> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER POLITICAL PRESSURE TO MOVE FAST IN THE RODNEY KING CASE </s>
<s> WE DEMAND SOME SWIFT ACTION AND SOME EFFECTIVE ACTION </s>
<s> MAYOR TOM BRADLEY OF LOS ANGELES PRAISED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR <UNK> THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> BUT WHETHER THE NEW LEGAL MOVES WILL BE ENOUGH TO HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION ON THE STREETS IS STILL FAR FROM CERTAIN </s>
