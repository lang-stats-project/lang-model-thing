<s> FEDERAL MARSHALS ARE STATIONED AT A NUMBER OF ABORTION CLINICS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING DEATHS OF A DOCTOR AND HIS ESCORT IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA LAST WEEK </s>
<s> GROUPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE HAVE DENOUNCED THE MURDERS </s>
<s> BUT THE SHOOTINGS HAVE INCREASED TENSIONS IN AN ALREADY INTENSE DEBATE </s>
<s> A MOVEMENT KNOWN AS COMMON GROUND HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO GET BOTH SIDES OF THE ABORTION DEBATE TO SIT DOWN AND FIND ISSUES THEY CAN AGREE ON </s>
<s> THEY SAY TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE </s>
<s> BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS WITHIN THE GROUP ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THE MURDERS WILL HAVE ON THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE A PEACEFUL DIALOGUE </s>
<s> FROM SAINT LOUIS NPR'S KATHY LOHR HAS THIS REPORT </s>
<s> PEOPLE IN COMMON GROUND AGREE TO DISAGREE OVER THE ISSUE OF ABORTION </s>
<s> THEN THEY SEARCH FOR COMMON GOALS THAT THEY CAN WORK ON TOGETHER LIKE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNWANTED PREGNANCIES </s>
<s> OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS COMMON GROUND GROUPS HAVE SPRUNG UP IN HALF A DOZEN CITIES INCLUDING BUFFALO CLEVELAND CINCINNATI AND DENVER </s>
<s> A NATIONAL OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED IN WASHINGTON D. C. LAST JANUARY A KIND OF CLEARING HOUSE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY THIS APPROACH </s>
<s> BUT EFFORTS TO BRING TOGETHER THOSE WHO'VE BECOME BITTER ENEMIES ARE STILL FRAGILE </s>
<s> AND SOME ARE WONDERING WHETHER THE VIOLENCE WILL SET THE MOVEMENT BACK </s>
<s> THE FIRST COMMON GROUND GROUP BEGAN IN SAINT LOUIS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO </s>
<s> LORETTA WAGNER IS A LONG TIME ANTI ABORTION ACTIVIST WHO HELPED GET THE EFFORT GOING </s>
<s> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CYNICISM AND SUSPICION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE REGARDING COMMON GROUND </s>
<s> UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME </s>
<s> AND I'M AFRAID THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY CAN GIVEN AMMUNITION TO PEOPLE TO SAY WELL LOOK WE'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU IT WAS THIS WAY </s>
<s> WHY DO YOU TRUST THOSE PEOPLE OR IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK </s>
<s> LORETTA WAGNER HOPES PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE BEYOND THEIR ANGER OVER LAST WEEK'S MURDER OF A DOCTOR AND HIS VOLUNTEER ESCORT AND REALIZE THAT THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO REVERSE THE HOSTILITY AND THE VIOLENT ATMOSPHERE THAT NOW EXISTS </s>
<s> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMMON GROUND SERVES TO DO I THINK IS TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC NOT CHANGING ANYBODY'S OPINION ON THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF ABORTION BUT JUST BEING ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE </s>
<s> ANTI ABORTION AND ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN MISSOURI AGREE ON REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ABORTIONS </s>
<s> A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE GROUP HELPED PASS LEGISLATION CREATING A TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN ADDICTED TO CRACK COCAINE AND ANOTHER MEASURE EXPANDING A SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM FOR POOR CHILDREN </s>
<s> NOW THEY'RE WORKING TO DEVELOP A STATE WELFARE REFORM MEASURE </s>
<s> PEOPLE WHO'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED COMMON GROUND GROUPS ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER </s>
<s> BUT THERE IS CONCERN THAT AFTER THE VIOLENCE MANY WHO NEVER ACCEPTED THE IDEA OR OTHERS JUST GETTING INVOLVED MAY BE PUT OFF </s>
<s> THE RECENT INCIDENT IN PENSACOLA IS VERY SERIOUS AND POSES A CHALLENGE TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE </s>
<s> B. J. <UNK> JONES RUNS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES A SAINT LOUIS CLINIC WHERE ABORTIONS ARE PERFORMED </s>
<s> SHE'S ALSO ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT </s>
<s> WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE PENSACOLA EVENT </s>
<s> WE'RE GRIEVING </s>
<s> THOSE OF US PROVIDERS ARE FRIGHTENED </s>
<s> WE NEED SOME TIME TO DO SOME HEALING BEFORE I NEED SOME TIME TO DO SOME HEALING BEFORE I CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT MUCH OF ANYTHING RIGHT NOW </s>
<s> THIS WEEK <UNK> JONES' PRIORITY IS THE SAFETY OF HER OWN STAFF </s>
<s> BUT THERE WILL BE NO <UNK> IN HER EFFORTS TO FURTHER COMMON GROUND AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO JOIN </s>
<s> IN FACT THREE NEW GROUPS ARE FORMING </s>
<s> THE MURDERS IN PENSACOLA CAUSED PEOPLE IN DALLAS TEXAS TO TAKE SOME QUICK ACTION </s>
<s> UP UNTIL NOW THE DALLAS GROUP HAD ONLY HELD A COUPLE OF MEETINGS TO GET ACQUAINTED </s>
<s> SINCE THE MURDERS ANTI ABORTION ACTIVIST JOHN <UNK> SAYS THE PEOPLE DECIDED TO MOVE UP THEIR TIME TABLE AND MEET LATER THIS WEEK </s>
<s> AT THAT TIME WE ARE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A MISSION STATEMENT WHERE WE CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW WE WANT TO GROW AND IN WHICH DIRECTION INITIALLY </s>
<s> AND THE SHOOTING DID HAVE A LOT TO GALVANIZE US TO GO FORWARD AND MOVE FORWARD VERY QUICKLY </s>
<s> THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT SAY TWO DECADES OF PROTESTS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO FURTHER THE OBJECTIVES OF EITHER SIDE OF THE ABORTION ISSUE </s>
<s> THEY'RE TIRED OF THE CONTROVERSY THE BITTERNESS AND THE VIOLENCE </s>
<s> THEY HOPE THE LATEST MURDERS WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SEARCH FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS AND PERHAPS THEIR OWN COMMON GROUP </s>
