<s> COMING UP ON ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AN EDITOR OF THE RUSSIAN NEWSPAPER PRAVDA SAYS BORIS YELTSIN'S DECISION TO BAN THE PAPER IS PURELY <UNK> </s>
<s> SOME STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN BETHLEHEM PENNSYLVANIA SAY MANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE IS NOTHING BUT SLAVERY IN DISGUISE AND PAUL SIMON WITH AND WITHOUT <UNK> </s>
<s> STAY TUNED </s>
<s> RESIDENTS OF MOSCOW WILL HAVE TO LIVE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR AT LEAST ONE MORE WEEK </s>
<s> THAT WORD TODAY FROM RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN </s>
<s> IT HAS BEEN SIX DAYS SINCE YELTSIN PUT DOWN AN ARMED INSURRECTION AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT AND AMONG THE MEASURES HE TOOK TO CONSOLIDATE HIS RULE WAS THE SHUT DOWN OF A HANDFUL OF ANTI YELTSIN NEWSPAPERS </s>
<s> AMONG THEM IS PRAVDA THE PRO COMMUNIST NEWSPAPER </s>
<s> VIKTOR <UNK> IS <UNK> DEPUTY EDITOR IN CHIEF </s>
<s> IT'S A PURELY I THINK <UNK> MEASURE </s>
<s> WE'RE WITNESSING AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW SO MANY VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION BROUGHT BY YELTSIN AND HIS GOVERNMENT THAT BANNING PRAVDA OR I SHOULD SAY SUSPENDING IT FOR A WHILE IS LOOKS LIKE A VERY MINOR THING </s>
<s> THERE ARE ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED ARRESTED PEOPLE STILL IN CUSTODY THAT IS AFTER THE SIEGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE </s>
<s> THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED DEAD AS WE KNOW AND THERE IS MANY MANY HUNDREDS WOUNDED </s>
<s> IF YOUR NEWSPAPER WERE BEING PUBLISHED RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU BE WRITING </s>
<s> YOU KNOW WE THE WEST IS APPLAUDING DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA BUT WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS WE HAVE CENSORSHIP <UNK> OF THE OLD COMMUNIST DAYS </s>
<s> WE HAVE ACTUALLY BASICALLY A COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP OF BREZHNEV STRIPE IN WHICH WE HAVE NO PARLIAMENT WHERE WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION NO OPPOSITION PRESS AND SO ON </s>
<s> SO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT PRAVDA TO WRITE </s>
<s> IT'LL BE A VERY VERY DREARY EXISTENCE I SHOULD SAY FOR A NEWSPAPER </s>
<s> THAT IS PURPORTING TO WRITE TRUTH ABOUT EVENTS </s>
<s> WELL WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OPPOSITION VOICE IN RUSSIA NOW </s>
<s> WILL IT GO UNDERGROUND </s>
<s> THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW YELTSIN FORCES IS PUSHING IT TO GO BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY'RE BANNING ALL THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION </s>
<s> THEY WANT TO HAVE A SO CALLED TOY OPPOSITION OR A POCKET OPPOSITION I SHOULD SAY ONE THAT CAN DO NO HARM TO THEM AT ALL </s>
<s> BUT THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION IS BANNED EFFECTIVELY </s>
<s> IT CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS </s>
<s> IT CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS </s>
<s> THIS IS THE EFFECT WHAT YOU KNOW YELTSIN'S BAN EFFECTIVELY DOES AND IN THIS LIGHT YOU KNOW OF COURSE <UNK> ROLE IS ON THE ONE HAND IS VERY IMPORTANT </s>
<s> ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THE CENSORSHIP THE YELTSIN REGIME IMPOSED </s>
<s> THE ELECTIONS ARE IN DECEMBER </s>
<s> DO YOU EXPECT THAT PRAVDA WILL BE PUBLISHING SOMETIME BEFORE THOSE ELECTIONS SO THAT IN FACT THE OPPOSITION MAY HAVE A VOICE WHEN THOSE ELECTIONS ARE HELD </s>
<s> YES </s>
<s> I THINK OF COURSE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT PROBABLY PRAVDA WILL BE PUBLISHED BEFORE ELECTIONS </s>
<s> ACTUALLY WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH AS SOON PROBABLY AS YOU KNOW WITHIN A WEEK OR MAYBE TWO WEEKS </s>
<s> BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WITH THE TOTAL MONOPOLY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE YELTSIN GOVERNMENT ON TELEVISION WITH THE TOTAL MONOPOLY ALMOST TOTAL MONOPOLY I SHOULD SAY ON THE WRITING MEDIA WHATEVER CHANNEL THAT PRAVDA PROVIDES FOR THE OPPOSITION WOULD BE A VERY LIMITED ONE </s>
<s> AND GIVEN THE DISARRAY THAT THE OPPOSITION OR WHATEVER THE CENTER IN THE COUNTRY ARE IN AFTER THE EVENTS THE TRAGEDY OF THE WHITE HOUSE I THINK IT'LL BE IT LOOKS LIKE A TRAVESTY OF ELECTION BASICALLY </s>
<s> THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT PRAVDA HAS BEEN BANNED THOUGH IN RECENT YEARS IS IT </s>
<s> THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU KNOW SINCE AUGUST OF NINETY ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN STOPPED </s>
<s> AND WHO ISSUED THE ORDER THE FIRST TIME </s>
<s> I THINK ACTUALLY IRONICALLY THIS IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE IRONIES OF OUR TIME </s>
<s> IRONICALLY THE FIRST TIME THE LIST FOR SUSPENSION WAS MADE UP BY KHASBULATOV AND I WAS VERY PLEASE THAT PRAVDA WAS ON THAT LIST </s>
<s> THAT IS THE KHASBULATOV WHO IS NOW INCARCERATED BY YELTSIN HIS ERSTWHILE SUPPORTER AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE ERSTWHILE DEMOCRATS OF THE NINETY ONE COUP </s>
<s> VIKTOR <UNK> IS <UNK> DEPUTY EDITOR IN CHIEF </s>
