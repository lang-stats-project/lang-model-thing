<s> NOW CHECKING SOME POLITICAL NEWS IN THE UNITED STATES REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS WENT TO CAPITOL HILL TODAY AND MADE A CAMPAIGN PROMISE </s>
<s> BUT AS C. N. N.'S BOB FRANKEN REPORTS THEY SAY THEY WILL KEEP THE PROMISE ONLY IF THE G. O. P. WINS A MAJORITY OF SEATS IN THE HOUSE IN THE FALL ELECTIONS </s>
<s> IT WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL PHOTO OPS THREE HUNDRED REPUBLICAN HOUSE CANDIDATES SIGNING WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR CONTRACT WITH AMERICA </s>
<s> TODAY IS THE DAY WE AS REPUBLICANS MAKE OUR COMPACT WITH THE PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THEIR HOUSE AND RESTORE FAITH IN THE INSTITUTION OF THE CONGRESS </s>
<s> IT'S A TEN POINT PROMISE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'LL KEEP IF THEY TAKE OVER THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NO LONGER CONSIDERED UNTHINKABLE GIVEN THE WAY VOTERS FEEL </s>
<s> I FEEL THAT THE REPUBLICANS DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING THE COUNTRY THAN THE DEMOCRATS DO </s>
<s> POLLS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THE NATION HOLDS THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS IN VIRTUAL CONTEMPT </s>
<s> THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS CALL AN OPPORTUNITY </s>
<s> ONE OF THE P. R. PEOPLE CALLED THE HERD OF T. V. CAMERAS THE PRETTIEST PICTURE OF ALL </s>
<s> THEY WERE SHOOTING A MEGA STAGED EVENT </s>
<s> THE CONTRACT PLEDGES THAT IN A REPUBLICAN HOUSE THERE WILL BE VOTES WITHIN A HUNDRED DAYS ON TERM LIMITS WELFARE REFORM NEW ANTI CRIME LEGISLATION AND A SLEW OF FAMILIAR ECONOMIC PROPOSALS A VARIETY OF TAX CUTS INCLUDING OF COURSE CAPITAL GAINS </s>
<s> THERE'S THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT AND CONGRESSIONAL REFORM </s>
<s> THIS REPUBLICAN RALLY HAD DEMOCRATIC INFILTRATORS MOST IN TUXEDOS A SYMBOL THEY SAID OF G. O. P. SPECIAL INTEREST INFLUENCE </s>
<s> AND IN CASE ANYONE MISSED THE POINT THEY ALSO SENT IN A FAT CAT </s>
<s> AND IN CASE ANYONE STILL MISSED THEIR POINT </s>
<s> TODAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WARMED OVER STEW AND MORE TRICKLE DOWN </s>
<s> AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE THIS WAS A RALLY FOR CONGRESSMAN NEWT GINGRICH FORMER PARTISAN BOMB THROWER POSSIBLE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE </s>
<s> TODAY ON THESE STEPS WE ARE FOR THIS CONTRACT AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS RENEWING AMERICAN CIVILIZATION </s>
<s> PEOPLE DON'T THINK INDEPENDENTLY THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN SPECIAL INTERESTS BEING REELECTED </s>
<s> THAT'S ALL THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT </s>
<s> WHILE GIVEN THE CONGRESSIONAL <UNK> THESE DAYS BEFORE YOU CAN JUDGE THE SUCCESS OF THIS EVENT YOU'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE CANDIDATES ARE HELPED OR HURT BEING SO NEAR TO THE CAPITOL </s>
<s> BERNIE </s>
<s> BOB DO THE REPUBLICANS SAY IF THEY DO NOT TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE THEY WILL WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON PROBLEMS THE AMERICAN VOTERS CARE MOST ABOUT </s>
<s> THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THE REPUBLICANS SAY VERY MUCH THESE DAYS </s>
<s> THEY'VE BEEN QUITE CONFRONTATIONAL PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE </s>
<s> IN FACT THE REPUBLICANS SAY IF THEY DON'T NUMERICALLY TAKE OVER THE HOUSE BUT COME CLOSE THEY MAY STRIKE SOME DEALS WITH CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS TO TAKE ON THE DEMOCRATS ANYWAY </s>
<s> THANK YOU </s>
